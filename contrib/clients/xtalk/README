xtalk is a 4.3 BSD (available at your local ftp site) compatible talk client
for X11. It was written as an exercise in learning how to program in X11.

xtalk has been tested with X11R5 on the following platforms: SunOS 4.1.1, 
IRIX 3.3.2, AIX 1.2.1, AIX 3.1.

xtalk does NOT work with the 4.2 BSD talk daemon (NOTE, this is the default 
with SunOS) (however, if someone can point us to the source, we are willing
to give it a try).
