TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

The transfig directory contains the source for the transfig command
which generates a Makefile which translates Fig code to various graphics
description languages using the fig2dev program.  In previous releases,
this command was implemented as a shell script.

The fig2dev directory contains a general program for translating from
Fig code to other graphics desciption languages.  The dev subdirectory
contains a library of output drivers used by fig2dev.

Drivers currently exist for the following graphics langauges:
(E)EPIC macros, LaTeX picture environment, PIC, PiCTeX, PostScript, and TeXtyl.
Fig2dev can be configured with a subset of these drivers

The doc directory contains man pages for fig2dev and for the transfig command.
The subdirectory doc/manual contains a manual for using TransFig to create
documents with portable graphics.  The manual also contains a reference
guide describing Fig code in detail, and a description of TFX, an extension to
Fig code which is supported by the translators in this package.

Version 2.0 note: The PostScript translation implemented by fig2dev
now supports both the TFX version of Fig code and the V2.0, the dialect
used by XFig Version 2.0.  The other translations support only TFX.

1 May 1990
----------

Version 2.1 note: fig2dev now supports Fig code V2.1, which implements
the features of both TFX and V2.0.  V2.1 has some options which are
implemented only in the PS output mode, most notably the use of PS font
names in specifying text objects.  However, unlike V2.0, this feature
is optional in V2.1; TFX-style font specifiers are also supported and
can be translated in all output modes.  TFX and V2.0 are still supported.
