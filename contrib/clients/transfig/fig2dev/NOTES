A brief history of Fig translation programs.

Fig2dev is derived from f2p, the original program written by the author of Fig,
Supoj Sutanthavibul of the University of Texas at Austin, to translate Fig
code to PIC.  The devlopment is somewhat complex.

Supoj adapted f2p for PostScript ouput: f2ps.

I adapted f2p for PiCTeX output: fig2tex.

Frank Schmuck, then a graduate student at Cornell, adapted fig2tex for
LaTeX picture environment output: fig2latex.

Frank also enhanced Fig, giving us Fig-FS.  I in turn extended the
definition of Fig code and added corresponding features to Fig-FS.
I implemented this extension (TFX) in fig2tex, and in fig2ps, which
is an adaption of f2ps.

Conrad Kwok, then of the University of California at Davis, adapted
fig2tex for (E)EPIC output: fig2epic.

He also enhanced f2p to support the TFX extension: fig2pic.

I have now reorganized the five programs named fig2* into drivers for
a single tranlation program: fig2dev.
