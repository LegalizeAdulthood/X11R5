xcolors

Xcolors reads the rgb.txt file that defines the color names the X
server knows and displays the colors found.

For R5 there new features:

 o text region where you can try out different colors

 o scrollbar

 o -rgbfile for choosing an alternate color database

 o -near and -dist for only showing a spherical section of the RGB cube

The X11R4 README file:

This program was originally written by Paul Vixie as "a gross hack
intended to show off toolkit programming."  It was fixed up (slightly)
by Stephen Gildea and submitted to the X Consortium for inclusion in
the X11R4 distribution.  Paul doesn't want to have anything to do with
it any more.  I think it's useful, so I am currently maintaining it.

This is a quick Xt11 program that reads rgb.txt and generates a label widget
in each color found therein.  It's slow, there are probably better ways to do
what it does.  It's also reasonably cute.

Distribute freely except don't remove my name.  Add your own copyrights as you
please.  Note that many excerpts were ripped from the MIT toolkit examples.
