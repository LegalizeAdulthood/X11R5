This directory contains the sources for the emu menus.

The emu menu fileset consists of :

	README
	Imakefile	Makefile
	menus.c		menus.h
	test_menus.c	Test_menus.ad

   The Makefile in this directory will create a test program (test_menus)
for exercising many of the menu features.  It should be used in conjunction
with the Test_menus.ad resource file to work properly (type "xrdb -merge
Test_menus.ad").

   For the test program, clicking on a menu item will only execute a dummy
callback which prints information to stderr (/tmp/emu.log).  Also, for
this program setting or unsetting the menu item toggle checkmarks will not
work.

   The menus are an integral part of Emu system, but it is not necessary to
include them as part of the program as emu can stand alone.
