This directory contains the source for the Canvas widget. It is

The Imakefile in this directory will create a simple client to allow
testing features of the canvas.

The file .term-defaults contains resource declarations necessary for
the test client. You should call xrdb -merge on it.

To test out a specific function of the canvas, simply put a key binding
for it in .term-defaults.

Agreed, the procedure looks a bit weird, but it worked quite well
for me, you don't have to change actual code in the main
program to test different functions.
