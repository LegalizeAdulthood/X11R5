				Pixmap version 1.1

WHAT IS Pixmap?
==============

Pixmap is a pixmap editor based on XPM version 3 library from Arnaud Le Hors - 
GROUPE BULL, derived from Davor Matic's bitmap editor (Davor Matic is member
of the XConsortium AnneX).

Here is provided a program similar to the bitmap editor. As Bitmap, it provides
facilities to edit pixmaps stored in files in XPM 3 format.

NOTE: The XPM library is mandatory. You should have got and installed before 
proceeding.

See the Pixmap Manual (pixmap.man) for more details.

HOW TO GET Pixmap?
=================

New pixmap updates are announced on the comp.windows.x newsgroup, and on the
"pixmap-talk" list. All new "official" pixmap releases can be found by ftp on:

    export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) contrib	 (Boston, USA)
    avahi.inria.fr     (192.5.60.47) pub	 (Sophia Antipolis, France)


DOCUMENTATION:
=============

Pixmap is not fully documented but is also self explanatory. A Reference
Card in LaTeX format is joined which contains the main facilities of the
editor: accelerator keys, resources, application files, ... The rest of 
the information can be found in the manual file pixmap.man.
We can mail you a PostScript version of the documentation if you are not 
able to print it (quite impossible).

INSTALLATION:
============

To obtain the Pixmap editor program, first uncompress and untar the 
compressed tar file (or unshar the shar file) in an approriate directory.

Pixmap only compiles with Imake.
As Pixmap can have two different interfaces, based on Athena and Motif, 
(see MOTIF DISCUSSION about Motif version) you should look at the Imakefile 
to set the variables corresponding to the version you wish to obtain. The 
default version is the Athena one.

Variables of interest are :

	DEFINES
	DEPLIBS
	LOCAL_LIBRARIES

You should also look at the lines concerning the Pixmap.ad file creation.

In any case, you shoudl set up the XPM relative variables correctly.
These are XPM_INCLUDEDIR and XPM_LIBDIR.

Double check the Imakefile and type:

	xmkmf
	make depend
	make

which will build the pixmap program and its application defaults file. 
Then do:

     	make install
	make install.man

which will install the program, application defaults file and the pixmap 
man page.

If it fails, you may edit the Imakefile to add compilation flags to
suit your machine.

NOTE: A sample dotpixmap file (color configuration file) is created by the
Makefile based on the rgb.txt file in /usr/lib/X11. You can extract parts 
from this file to build your own .pixmap file used by Pixmap.

CONVERTERS:
==========

In the Xmu directory you can find different converters about XPM.
These are converters that can be installed in an application to allow
specification of pixmap resources in .Xdefaults and application default files.
No Makefile or Imakefile is provided to compile or install them.

MOTIF DISCUSSION:
================

The Motif version was tested under X11R4 with Motif 1.1. It currently
works under X11R5 by removing all callbacks of Activate callback list 
of all components (buttons and text) of dialogs (SelectionBox). The main 
problem comes from an incompatibility between X11R5 and Motif 1.1 causing
XtCallCallbackList to pass a null widget as first argument. This doesn't 
seem to be right for Motif 1.1 internal callbacks (and we can understand
why!).

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
==============

The accelerators don't seem to work with Athena.

DISCUSSION:
==========

There is a mailing list to discuss about Pixmap which is 
pixmap-talk@sophia.inria.fr.
Any request to subscribe should be sent to pixmap-talk-request@sophia.inria.fr.
