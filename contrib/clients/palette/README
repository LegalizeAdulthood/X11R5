WHAT IT IS

palette - X11 color FG/BG palette selection tool

Palette displays a list of the colors known to the standard colormap
(as described in the rgb.txt file).  The user can change the bf/fg
color combination with a text box to see how different combinations
look.  The colors may be sent to stdout as "-bg color -fg color" for
use on a command line.


HOW TO INSTALL IT

If you have imake, make the Makefile in the manner normal for your
environment (typically via xmkmf).  Otherwise, use Makefile.STD.

make install

will build and iinstall it.  If you are using imake, you may have to
type

make install.man

as well.


STILL TO DO

0) Widgetize the whole mess, or at least put it in a library
   routine.
1) Dynamic colors[] allocation, with dynamic width determination.
2) Dynamic toplevel width determination, based on (1)? Based on
   screen size?
3) Local colormap.

If you do any of this, please send me the diffs!  Likewise, I am
open to suggestions - they may or may not make it, but you might
as well try!
