told to monitor multiple hosts, or to monitor multiple statistics on the
same host.

Edit history

Patchlevel 7
	- Add composite stats for total packets, disk accesses, total
	  pages paged in and out, and total swaps.
	- Display version, scale and downtime, if appropriate, if mouse
	  button pushed while pointer is in stripchart.
	- Fixed bugs when determining if host is down.

Patchlevel 6
	- Clear stripcharts when monitored statistic is changed.
	- Allow setting of monitored stat in .Xdefaults.
	- Added -v option to display version number.
	- Fork new process to wait for dead host to come back up.

Patchlevel 5
	- Put explict closes of sockets back in after clnt_destroy().
	  Apparently some versions of clnt_destroy don't close the
	  socket.
	- Minor changes to XMeter.ad.

Patchlevel 4
	- Allow user to specify foreground, border, internal border and
	  highlight color for each level.
	- Fixed bug in determining width/height of form widget.
	- Allow user to specify label foreground and background colors
	  independently of stripcharts.
	- Made all colors either class Foreground or Background, should
	  simplify .Xdefaults files.

Patchlevel 3
	- Added "cols" and "rows" options, allows rectangular
	  layout of graphs.  Removed "orientation" option.
	- Backgrounds of stripcharts can now be set to user specified
	  bitmaps with "*Bitmap" resources.
	- Added op, wp, ep and fp options, which takes a program name as an
	  argument.  When a graph enters state OK, WARN, ERROR or FATAL, the
	  specified program is invoked.
	- Added menus which allow the monitored statistic to be changed
	  on the fly.

Patchlevel 2
	- Changed resource name of paned widgets to host name.
	- Used actual time between rstat(3) calls instead of "update"
	  interval for computing graph values.
	- Rewrote functions that return graph values.
	- Fixed divide by 0 errors in fcpu(), fsys() and fuser().
	- Use RSTATVERS_TIME instead of RSTATVERS.

Patchlevel 1
	- Fixed memory leak.
