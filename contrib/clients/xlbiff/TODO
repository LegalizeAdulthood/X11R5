*   Do like xbiffR5, popdown window if mailbox file is read?

*   Think of something to do if there are more than maxRows lines.  My
    guess would be to add scroll bars.

*   -refresh <time> flag, for when you pop it down and forget you have mail,
    perhaps it could re-pop-up every 30 minutes or so?

*   <from gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu> pop up alert window on error
