%
%  CompileRegularExpression returns NULL for a failure, where failures are
%  syntax errors, exceeding implementation limits, or applying `+' or `*'
%  to a possibly-null operand.
%
%  This is essentially the same routine written and copywrited by Henry 
%  Spencer, University of Toronto.  I made minor programming changes but 
%  major variable name changes to improve readibility.
%  
%  A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by `|'. It
%  matches anything that matches one of the branches.
%  
%  A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated. It matches a match for
%  the first, followed by a match for the second, etc.
%  
%  A piece is an atom possibly followed by `*', `+', or `?'. An atom
%  followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom. An
%  atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the
%  atom. An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or the null
%  pattern.
%  
%  An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for
%  the regular expression), a range (see below), `.' (matching any single
%  character), `^' (matching the null pattern at the beginning of the input
%  pattern), `$' (matching the null pattern at the end of the input pattern),
%  a `\' fol- lowed by a single character (matching that character), or a
%  single character with no other significance (matching that character).
%  
%  A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'. It normally
%  matches any single character from the sequence. If the sequence begins
%  with `^', it matches any single charac- ter not from the rest of the
%  sequence. If two characters in the sequence are separated by `-', this
%  is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them (e.g.
%  `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit). To include a literal `]' in the
%  sequence, make it the first character (following a possible `^').  To
%  include a literal `-', make it the first or last character.
%  
%  If a regular expression could match two different parts of the input
%  pattern, it will match the one which begins earliest. If both begin in
%  the same placebut match dif- ferent lengths, or match the same length
%  in different ways, life gets messier, as follows.
%  
%  In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are con- sidered in
%  left-to-right order, the possibilities for `*', `+', and `?' are
%  considered longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the
%  outermost in, and concatenated con- structs are considered
%  leftmost-first. The match that will be chosen is the one that uses the
%  earliest possibility in the first choice that has to be made. If there
%  is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same manner
%  (earli- est possibility) subject to the decision on the first choice.
%  And so forth.
%  
%  For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways. The
%  first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab' is earlier, and does
%  lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen. Since the `b' is
%  already spoken for, the `b*' must match its last possibility-the empty
%  pattern-since it must respect the earlier choice.
%  
%  In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there is only one
%  `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the longest possible match
%  will be chosen. So `ab*', presented with `xabbbby', will match `abbbb'.
%  Note that if `ab*' is tried against `xabyabbbz', it will match `ab'
%  just after `x', due to the begins-earliest rule. (In effect, the deci-
%  sion on where to start the match is the first choice to be made, hence
%  subsequent choices must respect it even if this leads them to
%  less-preferred alternatives.)
