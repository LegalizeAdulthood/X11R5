Xtp is a utility for retrieving, listing, or printing files from a
remote network site.  Xtp performs most of the same functions as the
ftp program, but does not require any interactive commands.  You simply
specify the file transfer task on the command line and xtp performs the
transfer automatically.

To retrieve file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z from host export.lcs.mit.edu, 
use:

  xtp -binary -retrieve ImageMagick.tar.Z export.lcs.mit.edu contrib

Xtp requires 4.3 BSD compatibilities.  I have successfully executed it on
a SUN, DEC Ultrix, MIPS, IBM RS/6000, and Ardent Titan.
