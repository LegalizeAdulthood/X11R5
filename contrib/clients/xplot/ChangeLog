10/4/91: Arthur Smith
	 Cleaned things up, ready for submission to the X contrib people.
	 (eg., wrote an Imakefile)

10/2/91: Arthur Smith
	 Added support for filling closed regions, fixed the
	 copyrights, etc. Note the fill tile pattern algorithm
	 was suggested by my wife (ie. I just wanted something 
	 that I could get working real quick.)

10/1/91: Arthur Smith
	 Merged Rich's changes (see below) with my own.
	 Added support for changing color and fonts from within
	 standard plot(5) files using the "linemod" command.
	 Changed the way cont() works so that a continuous line
	 is only plotted after all its points have been read. That
	 means dashed lines are now done correctly, and it becomes
	 easy to check for closed curves to do filling.
	
9/30/91: Arthur Smith (asmith@icose.msd.anl.gov)
Completely reorganized the files used:
	main.c: Contains option parsing and the information routines
		- calls openpl() plus sets various external paramters.
	openpl.c: Initializes input stream and the X window. Also
		various convenience routines that don't do anything
		except use X calls.
		- calls doplot() and resize()
	plotting.c: Contains doplot (central plotting routine)
		    buttonwait (waiting at the end after a fork)
		    resize (implement resizing of the window)
		- calls readit() and plot routines 
	readin.c: buffering routines - to put things into
		the storage buffer if wanted, and generally
		to take care of nonblocking input.
	plot.c: The low-level plotting routines.

	* xplot.c: added missing calls to display_version() and
	  display_help () in main().

	* xplot.c: fixed input buffering for files named on the
	  command line.

Tue Jul 16 22:27:13 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* xplot.c:   Recompute the x and y scale factors after changing
	  the window size in resize().

Wed Jul  3 16:58:33 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* plot.c: Handle zero length strings just as non-zero strings are.
	  getstrring returns -1 for missing newline, so a return value of
	  zero means a zero length string.

Fri May 10 04:09:17 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* plot.c: implemented color().  It sets the foreground color.

Tue May  7 01:23:00 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* alabel.c: used "fixed" if we can't get the default font from the
	server.

	* xplot.c: started over using the version of xplot.c provided with
	gnuplot version 2.0 and folded back in the GNU specific code.
	Resize works now!

	* new files: plot.c plot.h.  These are the parts of xplot.c which
	are not shared with the gnuplot version, and should be covered
	by the GPL, whereas xplot.c is not.

	* Makefile: added dependencies for plot.c plot.h, TAGS and test.

Sun Apr 14 15:50:24 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* xplot.c: removed `*xplot' from fallback resources.  I think
	this is unnecessarily restrictive in that it forces you to name
	the executable `xplot'.

Thu Mar 14 17:36:26 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at omicron)

	* Imakefile: Richard Roy <dick@isl.stanford.edu>
	adds alabel.o to OBJ and alable.c to SRC.

Mon Mar 11 11:05:05 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* xplot.c: use getopt. added +catch-sighup and
	+dont-fork options.  This required moving the `signal()'
	to follow the option parsing.  Are there cases where
	the signal needs to be ignored sooner? Version 0.4

Sun Mar  3 15:09:49 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* alabel.c: load the default font if a named font does not
	exist in the server. This is version 0.3

Sat Nov 10 10:44:59 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* xplot.c: added program name to error message.

Wed Oct 17 22:02:32 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* xplot.c: fixed font resource bug in fallback_resources.
	Thanks to David W. Forslund <dwf%hope.ACL@lanl.gov> for catching it!
	* xplot.c, Makefile: added -v option which reports the version
	number. This is version 0.2.

Thu Sep 13 12:40:22 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* rewrote the X initialization code in openpl again in order to
	  avoid the bug in the Sun4 SunOS 4.1 kernel.  This time we
	  are reading the whole plot file into a buffer befor opening
	  any windows.  That seems to help.  It still needs to handle
	  resize events.

rich@rice.edu 7/29/89

* added file alabel.c containing plot functions for extended plot file
  format.

* changed label so that it calls alabel.

* added extensions to the main loop which reads in the plot file.

* added the `-debug' option.  The output is similar to the output
  of plottoa. So, except for the extensions we should be able to
  filter the output with /usr/bin/atoplot and then other plot filters
  to make debugging easier.

rich@rice.edu 8/13/90

* rewrote much of the X initialization code in openpl in order to
  avoid what seems to be a bug in the Sun4 SunOS 4.1 kernel.  If xplot
  crashes the OS with `bad trap' and `data fault' messages, you have been
  bit by this bug.

* changed from a label widget to a command widget.  This makes naturally makes
  the left button `QUIT' -- exit and close the window.

* keep all of the input read from stdin in a buffer.  Later on we can
  add a resize method which redraws the window using this data.

* Use XClearWindow after reaching the end each pipe full of data and after 
  the pipe is closed to force the display to expose all newly drawn lines and
  text in the pixmap.

* fork() after the end of file is reached, so that the parent process
  can continue while the window stays on the screen.
