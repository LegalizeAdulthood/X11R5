Implement the command line options in GNU graphics:
	fontsize, font, --
	signed, unsigned -- ??

Implement the enhancements to "plot"
		  r: rotate() -- to rotate text...
	- put fillstyle option in the "label" command

Check into the V9 plot file format... nahhh.
	(Probably better to put that into "plot2plot" or something
	 like that.)

Plus: Get library, named pipe, etc. working
