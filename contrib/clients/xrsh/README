This distribution contains two programs, xrsh and xrlogin. 

Both are shell scripts.

Xrsh is designed to allow you to start an X client on a remote machine
with the window displayed on the current server's $DISPLAY.  In X11R4
and previous, xrsh was called "xon".   There is now a script in X11R5
by Keith Packard by that name which has no relation to the originally
distributed xon script.

Xrlogin opens a local xterm window and runs rlogin or telnet to
connect to a remote machine.

The X11R5 version of xrsh has many new features including a multitude
of X access control methods, the ability to pass arbitrary environment
variables to the remote host and the ability to start a client on a
different screen than the current one.

To install on your system, the usual thing is to do an "xmkmf"
followed by a "make install".

IMPORTANT:

If you are running a System V variant, change the first line of both
scripts from "#!/bin/sh" to ": ".

If you are running on an Ultrix system, change the first line from
"#!/bin/sh" to "#!/bin/sh5" because ultrix /bin/sh is archaic.
