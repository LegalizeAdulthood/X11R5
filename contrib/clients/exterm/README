			Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here


This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.  It was one of
the first "serious" programs ported, and still has a lot of historical baggage.
Ideally, there would be a general tty widget and then vt102 and tek4014 
subwidgets so that they could be used in other programs.  We are trying to 
clean things up as we go, but there is still a lot of work to do.

If you are porting this to a machine that has problems with overlapping
bcopy's, watch out!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The statements above is copied from README of xterm, we put here to 
remind you the exterm also inherits ugly features of xterm since it
is produced from xterm.

The exterm simulates a terminal to process multibyte characters, which
is encoded in the locale.  All of locale definitions are put in the 
default system directory /usr/lib/X11/nls.  The command options of exterm
is same as xterm besides the following different options:

1). -fn & -fb

    The option -fn accepts the font set whose name consists of base font
    names defined in X11R5. All fonts of font set shoud be the type of
    CharCell fonts with same heigh and wide width.  The default is only
    one font "fixed".
    The option -fb is not recommented to use, instead the facility of
    bolding is to overstrike the normal font set.

    The resource for this option is fontSet (class FontSet).

2). -imstyle

    This is new option to xterm.  This option specifies which style of
    Input Method to be connected with the input manager xwnmo. Specifying
    this option, user can input multibyte characters from keyboard under
    the control of input manager, of course.  The default is none, no
    connection with the input manager.

    The resource for this option is preeditType (class PreeditType).

    To connect with xwnmo, you need to set envoronment variable $XMODIFIERS
    before running exterm, just like following.

	% setenv XMODIFIERS @im=_XWNMO

3). -plist

    This option specifes the some fonts of fontset to be pre-loaded into.
    The option is only valid when the exterm and Xlib is compiled by -DXML.
    The default is no fonts to be pre-loaded.

    The resource for this option is ploadFontList (class PloadFontList).

4). -xnllanguage

    This option specifis the locale name as form lang_terr.codeset, and
    decides the encoding of the exterm at run-time.  If the option is
    omitted, exterm will look at the environment variable $LANG; if
    still failed, the default is locale "C".

    The resource for this option is xnlLanguage (class XnlLanguage).

The locale of exterm can be changed on-the-fly by selecting menu with the
Button3 of mouse at run-time(of course you can change the button convention
with respect to Xt translation table).  There is also a new escape control
sequence to change the locale as inputting the sequence:

	<ESC>]3;<Pt><BEL>

where the <ESC> is escape character, the <BEL> is belling character and
the <Pt> is locale name of ASCII printable string.

The communication codeset of exterm with other clients is Compound Text
Encoding defined in X11R5.

To run the exterm, please make sure where the locale database is. The
default path is /usr/lib/X11/nls, or specified with the environment
variable $XNLSPATH.

To build exterm you should use the following commands:

	% cd exterm
	% xmkmf <Topdir> <Curdir> (you may set Topdir and Curdir)
	% make includes
	% make depend
	% make all

After building, It can be installed in your local bin using:

	% make install


	Enjoy!
