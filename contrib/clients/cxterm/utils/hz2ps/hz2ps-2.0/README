The program "hz2ps" converts a hanzi (GB/BIG5) file to PostScript.

Hz2ps 2.0 is an significantly improved version of hz2ps 1.0, which was
released back in 1989. The bugs which limit the number of pages that can be
printed have been fixed. It now accepts both GB (HGB) and BIG5 files.
Style files used in v1.0 are no longer supported; instead various
options can now be more conveniently specified in the command line.
Please see the man page "hz2ps.1" for details.

Let $HZ be the directory containing the font files.
To install hz2ps:

1. mv hz2ps.pro $HZ
2. setenv HZDIR $HZ
3. make hz2ps

As far as the author knows, as of today, there is only one easily
accessible but copyrighted "FanTi" bitmap font file on the network.
It is the font file "chinese.16" provided by Hong Kong University
(available on the ftp site ahkcus.org, for example).
Also supplied in this package is a utility program called "hku2hz", which
can convert "chinese.16" into the format used by "hz2ps".

Suppose $HZ contains the file "chinese.16".
To install and use hku2hz:

1. make hku2hz
2. hku2hz chinese.16 hku-ch16

Examples:

To print a GB file:

% hz2ps foo.gb | lpr

To print a BIG file:

% hz2ps -big -hf hku-ch16 10 1 -hbm 16 foo.big | lpr
