INTRODUCTION
============

	C-Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor. C-Elvis
	supports editing of Chinese text, English text, and the mixture
	of both. C-Elvis supports nearly all the vi/ex commands, in both
	vi[sual] mode and ex (colon) mode, for both Chinese and English
	characters.

	C-Elvis is for both GB2312-80 standard (GuoBiao) Chinese internal
	encoding and Big5 encoding Chinese text.

	C-Elvis requires a Chinese terminal to input/output Chinese
	character. An example is the X11R5 cxterm.

INSTALLATION
============

	The Makefile contains the necessary steps to compile C-Elvis. The
	command name is "celvis" by default, but you may rename it or make
	the following aliases of celvis:

		cvi	starts up in vi (visual) editing mode, same as celvis.
		cex	starts up in ex (line) editing mode
		cview	runs vi without write permission, i.e. readonly
		cedit	starts up in insert mode
	
	You shouldn't have too much problems if you are familiar with UNIX 
	vi/ex. "elvis.man" contains the usages of all the commands and
	keys which you may want to know.

PORTABILITY
===========

	This version of C-Elvis is developed and tested on Sun SparcStation
	and X11R5 cxterm. The original Elvis 1.3 can run under BSD UNIX,
	AT&T SysV UNIX, and MS-DOS. The code for these operating systems
	remains in C-Elvis, but never be tested.

	We welcome any attempt to try C-Elvis on other UNIX workstations,
	or any Chinese DOS. Please refer to elvis.man for guides.

DISTRIBUTION
============

	This version of C-Elvis is freely redistributable, in either
	source form or executable form. It is provided "as is" without
	express or implied warranty.

	C-Elvis is based on Steve Kirkendall's Elvis 1.3, a public domain
	vi/ex clone. We appreciate Steve Kirkendall for writing this
	wonderful elvis, and granted us the permission to develop
	C-Elvis based on it and redistribute it.

BUGS
====

	You are welcome to mail comments, bug-reports, and modification
	to "c-elvis@cs.purdue.edu". We are going to create a mailing list
	of those who are interested in the future development of this
	software. So if you get a copy, and/or you want to be on the
	list, please send mail to "c-elvis@cs.purdue.edu".
