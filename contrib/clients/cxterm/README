-------------------------------------------------------------------


1. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

Cxterm and related software:

cxterm	-- a Chinese terminal emulator for X11R5. 
dict	-- a set of dictionaries (input methods) for cxterm.
fonts	-- a set of X11 Chinese fonts.

Chinese processing software:

utils	-- a small set of Chinese language processing programs to be used
        in cxterm, including Chinese vi and emacs editors, file viewer cless,
	Chinese text to Postscript converter, and Chinese encoding conversion
	programs.

About 8.5M disk space is needed for the source:

	cxterm	 	 766K
	dict	 	 265K
	fonts		6555K
	utils	 	 800K

and additional 5M is needed to build all the binaries and fonts.

2. HOW TO INSTALL ALL THESE SOFTWARE

All the path names mentioned here are refer to this directory,
i.e. X11R5/contrib/client/cxterm.

2.1  CXTERM, DICT, and FONTS

First of all you need to have X11R5 MIT core distribution installed
in your system.  The directory containing X11R5 binaries (especially,
xmkmf, bdftopcf, etc.) should be included in the PATH.

Imakefiles are supplied in each directories and subdirectories
of cxterm, dict, and fonts.  Makefile is given in this top directory.
Simply type:

	make >& all.log							# (m1)

Check all.log to see if the build is successful.  If yes, you can
install most of it with:

	make install >& install.log					# (i1)

(If you don't have the privilege to install, see section 3.)
You can install man pages with:

	make install.man >& man.log					# (i2)

In case the top-level Makefile is corrupt during the period of making,
use
	make -f Makefile.ini World

2.2  UTILS

Individual Makefiles are supplied in every subdirectories under
./utils.  You will build most of them by

	(cd utils; make)						# (m2)

However, each package may need special making procedure.  You'd
better go down to each subdirectory of ./utils and read the README
and Makefile first.

----------
3. WHAT IS TO BE GENERATED

If the build (m1) is successful, you have the following executable
binaries:

	cxterm/cxterm
	cxterm/hzimpath
	dict/tit2cit/tit2cit
	dict/tit2cit/cit2tit

The build will also generate X11 fonts

	fonts/cclib16st.pcf		or 	fonts/cclib16st.snf
	fonts/cclib16fs.pcf			fonts/cclib16fs.snf
	fonts/cclib24st.pcf			fonts/cclib24st.snf
	fonts/hku-ch16.pcf			fonts/hku-ch16.snf

depends on your system configuration.  ".snf" files are machine-dependent,
and ".pcf" files are not.  You need to build separate ".snf" for each
type of machine, while one ".pcf" file fits all machines.

The following cxterm dictionaries are built:

	dict/tit/CCDOSPY.cit
	dict/tit/CTCPS3.cit
	dict/tit/ETZY.cit
	dict/tit/PY-b5.cit
	dict/tit/PY.cit
	dict/tit/Punct-b5.cit
	dict/tit/Punct.cit
	dict/tit/SW.cit
	dict/tit/TONEPY.cit
	dict/tit/ZOZY.cit

You can put all of them in a dedicated directory and set environment
variable HZINPUTDIR to the directory name before invoking cxterm.

The following manual pages are useful:

	cxterm/cxterm.man
	cxterm/hzimpath.man
	dict/tit2cit/tit2cit.man
