ABOUT GB ENCODING FONTS
-----------------------

Here "GB encoding" refers to the Standard "Code of Chinese Graphic Character
for Information Interchange, Primary Set (GB2312-80)", published by National
Standards Bureau, Beijing, China in 1980.  

All the fonts are in GR encoding, i.e. the most significant bit of each octet
of a character in the font is one (1).

cclib16fs.bdf, cclib16st.bdf, cclib24st.bdf were from Institute of Software,
Academia Sinica (ISAS), Beijing, CHINA.

ABOUT BIG5 ENCODING FONTS
-------------------------

Here "BIG5 encoding" refers the the HKU Big5 encoding, a variant of
the widely used de facto standard, so-called "Big5".

The major difference between the ETen coding, the probably most widely
used Big5 variant, and HKU Big5 is the offset of non-frequent Big5
Hanzi codes in the ETen coding scheme:

portions of BIG5 codes    coding in ETen      coding in HKU-Ch16
----------------------    ----------------    ----------------
Non-Chinese symbols       0xa140 -- 0xa3bf    0xa140 -- 0xa3fe
Frequent (5401)           0xa440 -- 0xc67e    0xa440 -- 0xc67e
Non-frequent (7652)       0xc940 -- 0xf9d5    0xc6a1 -- 0xf755
Non-BIG5 supplement       0xf9d6 -- ??          no
