.SH NAME
sgi2tiff \- create a
.SM TIFF
file from an
.SM SGI
image file
.SH SYNOPSIS

[
.B \-none

.B \-packbits

.B \-lzw
] [
.B \-rowsperstrip
.I n

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sgi2tiff
converts a file in the 
.SM SGI
image format to
.SM TIFF.
By default, the
.SM TIFF
image is created with data samples packed (\c
.IR PlanarConfiguration =1),
compressed with the Lempel-Ziv & Welch algorithm (\c
.IR Compression =5),
and with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.
These characteristics can overriden, or explicitly specified
with the following options:
.B \-none
(use no compression),
.B \-packbits
(use the PackBits compression algorithm),
.B \-lzw
(use Lempel-Ziv & Welch \- default),
.B \-rowsperstrip
.I n
(pack
.I n
rows in each strip).
Any colormap information in the rasterfile is carried over to the
.SM TIFF
file by including a
.I Colormap
tag in the output file.
If the rasterfile has a colormap, the
.I PhotometricInterpretation
tag is set to 3 (palette);
otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB) if the depth
is 24 or 1 (min-is-black) if the depth is not 24.
.SH BUGS
Does not record colormap information.
