.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fax2tiff
creates a
.SM TIFF
file containing 
.SM CCITT
Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files containing ``raw''
Group 3 encoded data (typically obtained directly from a fax modem).
Each row of data in the resultant
.SM TIFF
file is 2-dimensionally encoded and
padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as needed.
The resultant image is series of low resolution (98 lines/inch)
or medium resolution (196 lines/inch)
pages, each of which is a single strip of data.
By default, the image conforms to the proposed
.SM TIFF
Class F (\c
.SM FAX\c
) specification for storing facsimile data.
This means, in particular, that each page of the data does
.B not
include the trailing 
.I "return to control"
(\c
.SM RTC\c
) code; as required
for transmission by the
.SM CCITT
Group 3 specifications.
The old, ``classic'', format is created if the
.B \-c
option is used.
(The Class F format can also be requested with the
.B \-f
option.)
.PP
The default name of the output image is
.IR fax.tif ;
this can be changed with the
.B \-o
option.
Each input file is assumed to be a separate page of facsimile data
from the same document.
The order in which input files are specified on the command
line is the order in which the resultant pages appear in the
output file.
.PP
By default, the output file is compressed with the 2-dimensional
version of the
.SM CCITT
Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.
If the
.B \-1
option is specified, 1-dimensional Huffman encoding will be used.
If the
.B \-4
option is specified,
.SM CCITT
Group 4 Huffman encoding will be used.
.PP
By default, the output file is created with bits filled from
least significant bit (\c
.SM LSB\c
) to most significant bit (\c
.SM MSB\c
).
This 
.I "fill order"
can be reversed with the
.B \-O
option.
.I Fax2tiff
expects that the bit ordering of data in the input file is
likewise set from
.SM LSB
to
.SM MSB.
If the reverse is true, the
.B \-r
flag should be specified.
.PP
To force the last bit of each
.I "End Of Line"
(\c
.SM EOL\c
) code to land on a byte boundary, the
.B \-p
flag should be specified.
This ``zero padding'' will be reflected in the contents of the
.I Group3Options
tag of the resultant
.SM TIFF
file.
.PP
By default,
.I fax2tiff
assumes that alll input files contain 1-dimensionally
encoded Group 3 data.
If the
.B \-2
option is specified,
.I fax2tiff
will assume the input files contain 2-dimensionally
encoded Group 3 data.
.PP
The input data are assumed to have a vertical
resolution of 196 lines/inch.
If the images are low resolution facsimile (98 lines/inch),
the
.B \-l
flag should be specified.
.PP
By default,
.I fax2tiff
prints only diagnostics about badly formed input rows.
If the
.B \-w
flag is supplied,
additional warning information will be printed 
about input data rows that are longer or shorter than 1728 pixels.
.PP
If the
.B \-v
option is specified,
.I fax2tiff
will print the number of rows of data it retrieved from the input file.
If this option is given twice, voluminous information about the
length of each encoded run in the input file will be printed.
.PP
Some fax files have garbage information at their front.
The
.B \-k
flag causes
.I fax2tiff
to skip three rows of input data before starting to its normal operation.
(It
.B should
skip rows until a row with a just an
.SM EOL
is encountered.)
.PP
For viewing, a one-to-one row conversion of fax data results
in an image that appears squashed.
If the
.B \-s
flag is supplied,
.I fax2tiff
will ``stretch'' the image vertically by writing each row of
input data twice in the output file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR "%s: Warning, row %d short (len %d).\en" .
The input data had a row that was shorter than the expected value of 1728.
The row is padded with white.
.PP
.BR "%s: Bad code word at row %d, x %d (len %d code 0x%x), skipping to EOL\en" .
An invalid Group 3 
.I code
was encountered while decoding the input file. 
The length of the code (in bits) and its value is displayed.
The row number and horizontal position is also given.
The remainder of the input row is discarded, while
the corresponding output row is padded with white.
.PP
Some internal errors that should never happen.
.SH NOTES
This program is derived from a similar program by Paul Haeberli
and uses code written by Jef Poskanzer.
.SH BUGS
Should synchronize finding the top of the input file by looking for
a row with just an
.SM EOL .
Should not have the constant width 1728 built into it.
Input data are assumed to have a a ``top left'' orientation;
it should be possible to override this assumption
from the command line.
