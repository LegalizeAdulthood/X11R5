				GWM KNOWN BUGS:
				###############

This is the list of bugs that we are aware of in the current release.

				###############

in mwm emulation, if you select something in a menu icon and re-click too fast
just after, the pop-up menu and icon title will stay on screen.

the new mwm-like resize style is not fully operational yet

there is not way to know that a window is resized

gwm does not use motion events, resulting in some cases of polling the server
(active waiting)

Many built-in functions still do not check the type of their arguments,
causing possible bus errors when handled the wrong type of arguments.
We try to catch some bus errors, though...

"exit" to a tag outside of a file being loaded do impredictable results

The standard profile is not "polished" yet -- all contributions are welcome

The debugging functions are very crude.

We need to add new functions, you cannnot emulate fully all window managers
with the ones provided in this release...
