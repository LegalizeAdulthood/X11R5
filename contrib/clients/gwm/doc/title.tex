\section*{Acknowledgements}

Although I am the only designer and implementor of {\GWM}, the project could
not have been completed without the help of many individuals, namely:

Vania Joloboff, who created the KOALA BULL team at INRIA, and started the 
{\GWM} project, and KOALA members Vincent Bouthors and Daniel Dardailler
who tested {\GWM} and wrote {\WOOL} profiles.

Gilles Kahn, Francis Montagnac, and the CROAP team at INRIA who intensively
used {\GWM} and provided me with machines to develop it. A special thanks
goes to Janet Incerpi who corrected the documentation.

All my beta testers: Raphael Bernhard, Didier Poirot, Matthieu Devin,
Christophe Muller, Laurent Hill, Anne Marie Bustos, Simon Kaplan ...
and last, but certainly not least, Bob Scheifler himself!

And since July 1989, {\GWM} has been enhanced by the growing community of
the {\tt gwm-talk} mailing list, whose members are alas too numerous to be all 
cited here, but are giving me an invaluable feedback.
