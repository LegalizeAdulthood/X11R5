WHAT IS GWM?
============

The GWM (Generic Window Manager) is an extensible Window Manager for
the X Window System Version 11. It is based upon a WOOL (Window Object
Oriented Langage) kernel, which is an interpreted dialect of Lisp with
specific window management primitives. The user builds a window
manager by writing WOOL files to describe objects on the screen,
including a Finite State Machine triggering WOOL actions on response
to X events (e.g. mouse buttons) on that object.  Theses objects can
used as decorations around X applications windows, as pop-up menus or
as independent windows.

GWM should be able to emulate efficiently other window managers, and play
the same role for window managers as EMACS does for text editors.

UNPACKING a new distribution:
=============================

First, you should make a directory (for instance "/usr/local/gwm/") which we
will call GWMDIR in the following text, where you will build the gwm
distribution. If you already have a GWMDIR with old gwm sources in it, just
use it: new gwm files will overwrite the existing ones, but your local
configuration files (in the Make/ subdirectory) will be preserved.

Now, depending on how you get gwm,You should have the file named
gwm-XXX.tar.Z, where XXX is the revision number.  (you may want to take the
gwm-XXX.ps.Z file, which is the Postscript version of the documentation if you
are not able to print the LaTeX version included in the release).

Copy this file in the GWMDIR directory, then "cd" to it

uncompress it by "uncompress gwm-XXX.tar"

unpack it by "tar xf gwm-XXX.tar"


Now you should have the complete GWM distribution kit ready. Ask help from
you local unix guru if you fail to unpack.

The installation of gwm will look like:

				GWMDIR
				  |
				 gwm
				  |
C source files     +----+----+----+
	   	   |	|    |	  |
		  xpm  doc Make	 data

The files will be then compiled in brother directories of "gwm" (sons of
GWMDIR) in a stand-alone installation (using the Makefile.noXtree makefile), or
directly in the "gwm" directory itself in case of an installation by imake.

If you plan to update your sources by applying distributed patches, please
do a copy of the sources just as you got them before doing any changes to
the distributed files (except the Make.xxx local configuration files). The
Make directory will contain all your configuration options, that you will be
able to re-use between different gwm releases.

UPDATING:
=========

To update, just get the good gwm-YourVersion-to-NewVersion.patch.Z by ftp,
or mail, uncompress it, for instance in /tmp. then go in the gwm "GWMDIR/src" 
directory (which holds the "YourVersion" gwm release) and type:

	patch -p < /tmp/gwm-YourVersion-to-NewVersion.patch

(the patch utility is part of the X11 distribution, under the "util"
subdirectory there)

You now have a "NewVersion" release of GWM.

PS: Older patches might need the -p8 option of patches.

INSTALLATION:
=============

Old users might read the CHANGES file for a history of changes interesting
the user (revision.c contains the implementation changes). 

Read the docs in the "doc/" directory (gwm.tex is the manual in LaTeX
form).  In this directory, a KNOWN_BUGS file will contains the known
bugs for this version, and a TO_BE_DONE file will list the planned
enhancements. The documentation is in LaTeX format (IMPORTANT: see the
Makefile in the "doc/" directory to know how to print it. You will
need to include a postscript header "idraw.pro" and postscript files.
The LaTeX source should work with most dvi2ps programs. I use myself
Tomas Rokicki's dvips v5.0 that you can get by anonymous ftp on
labrea.stanford.edu).  We can mail you a PostScript version of the
documentation if you are not able to print it, or you can grab one on
the ftp servers.

NOTE: If your printer aborts while printing the PostScript version
of the doc, it is because your printer ran out of memory. Try then to
split the postscript in 20 pages chunks with your dvips program, or get the
splitted postscript file, gwm.ps-split.tar.Z, on a ftp server.

NOTE: if you cannot see page numbers in the postcript doc, it is because the
page has too much offset upwards. To correct it, go into each postcript file,
search for the first occurence of the line:

       TeXDict begin @a4

then 2 solutions:

- either change @a4 by @letter

- or insert BEFORE this line the line:
       0 -30 translate
  which brings down the page by 30 points (a point is a 72th of an inch).
  You could in fact put X Y translate where X and Y are x,y offsets...

The "data/" directory contains bitmaps, and wool (gwm built-in lisp) profiles.
It also contains the "rxterm" shell script used to spawn remote xterms. If
you do not have such a script already installed, you should install this script
and also make "rx" and "rxload" commands as links to it. (it is NOT installed
automatically to preserve existing ones)

Then you can either compile gwm via "imake" or in a stand-alone way.

WITH IMAKE:

	The Imakefile is provided. You should know how to use imake to build 
	the Gwm Makefile, by either:

		ximake TOP
	if your X source tree is in directory TOP, or:
		xmkmf 
	if your X source tree has been fully installed	

	then do a "make Makefiles" to build all the subdirectory
	Makefiles, then do a "make" which will build the "gwm" binary,
	and then do a "make install" and "make install.man" which will
	install the gwm binary, the data files in the "data/"
	subdirectory and the manual page.

	If it fails, you may edit the Imakefile to add compilation flags to
	suit your machine. (see make.TEMPLATE for the description of these
	flags). If you have to modify the provided Imakefile to compile on
	your machine, PLEASE mail me the changes!

	NOTE: the installation of the "data" subdir works only with the X11R4
	imake, with the R3, you will have to do it by hand. (do a
	"cp data/.*gwm data/* GWMDIR" where GWMDIR can be found in the 
	Imakefile.
	

WITHOUT IMAKE:

	To compile or install gwm, you must, in the "gwm" directory you just
	created, do a:

		cp Makefile.noXtree Makefile

	and for each type of machine on which you decide to install it:

	decide which name you will give to this type of machine ("dpx1000", 
	"sun", "vax"). Suppose it is "dpx" in the following. Don't try to name
	it "gwm" however!

	type: "make DIR=../dpx sdir" (or make DIR=dpx dir if you don't have
	symbolic links on your system)

	This will build a directory "../dpx", link all source files in it,
	copy the Make.TEMPLATE file to "Make.dpx" in the ../dpx
	directory, and make a link to this newly created file in "Make"
	subdirectory. If you want to create the target directory on another
	filesystem, you can use symbolic links to do so, Just say "make
	DIR=path sdir" where "path" is the complete pathname of the target
	directory, for instance "/usr/maalea/local/src/GWM/dpx"

	go into it ("cd ../dpx"), and edit the "Make.dpx" file to adapt it
	to your local installation. 

	Then, type "make" and a "gwm" executable should be built.
	In case of errors, a simple "make" should resume the
	compilation process after the first "make" command has been issued.
	If you have the message "Make:  Don't know how to make .dir.  Stop.",
	that means that you have forgotten to do "cd ../dpx".

	VERY IMPORTANT: if you encounter compilation problems, please mail me
	the problems and the patches you had to apply to make it compile
	on your system, so that I can include them in future releases!

	If everything is OK, type "make install", it should copy the
	executable and the whole ./data subdirectory. If you want to install
	it by hand, just copy gwm into your path, and the whole contents of
	the data directory (which can be shared between machines) into the gwm
	built-in path. (the built-in path is printed by gwm by: gwm -?)

	Then, you can delete the working directory. The only thing you need
	to keep is the "Make" directory, which contains all the things you may
        have defined or adapted for your configuration. 
        A link to the "Make.machine" in the "Make" subdirectory was 
	automatically generated by the "make dir" command,
	so that you do not have to worry about saving it before deleting
	the "machine" directory.

	The advantage of this scheme over the "imake" approach is that your
	local modifications are kept in the Make.machines files, and
	are not overwritten by new updates, so re-compiling new
	updates of gwm is just typing "make".


NOTES:
      - if you compile  with gcc, use "gcc -traditional", otherwise you may
        have compilation warnings (but the code will work Ok)
