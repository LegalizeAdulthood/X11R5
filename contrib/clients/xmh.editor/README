All C source changes are controlled by compilation switches. The modified
Imakefile has all switches turned on. Imakefile, xmh.man and Xmh.ad are also
modified.

xmh-mods-R5-1.0 is context diffs that can applied to the xmh sources with
patch.

	patch < xmh-mods-R5-1.0

Xmh has been tested and used at the SEI with all compilation switches on.
There has been very limited testing of a version built by applying only a
subset of the changes.

Comments and problems with these modifications can be mailed to
xmh-bugs@sei.cmu.edu. 

All modifications are controlled by the compilation switches list below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDITOR:

Permit the use of an external editor. The syntax is like xrn's

Xmh.editorCommand:      	gnu -i -w 80x35+100+20 %s
Xmh.editorCommand:      	xterm -e vi %s

If the external editor is GNU there is a "xmh.el" file (adapted from mh.el)
supplied that supports inserting any message or if the composition is a reply
inserting the current message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANNOTATE:  

Support MH annotations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPEND:

Append a message to a file.  The code was adapted from xrn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FCC:

Update the toc scan if the folder is a target of an fcc. This is
primarily for those that do an Fcc +inbox as it avoids a rescan.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIX:

Remove draft messages that generate errors on scan. Mail composition
fails if a poorly formed draft is left in the +drafts folder.
