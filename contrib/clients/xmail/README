  xmail is an X-based interface to the Berkeley mail program.  This is
  version 1.4 of xmail.  This version of xmail depends heavily upon the
  installation of the application default resources file for the proper
  declaration of features and enhancements documented in the man pages.
  If the defaults file or the resource declarations are not installed or
  in some manner made accessable to the X11 resource database manager,
  xmail will operate in only a minimal fashion.  Please see the man page
  for additional details.

  This version of xmail includes support for decompressing and displaying
  the content of an X-Face mail header, if such a header exists in the
  message being read.  This feature is a compile time option, and requires
  the existence of the compface library routines, which are NOT supplied
  with the xmail sources.    X-Face headers are compressed bitmap images,
  typically of the face of the person owning such a header.  The compressed
  header contains only printable characters, which allows it to be included
  in a mail message.  The USENIX FaceSaver project is typically the source
  for these bitmaps, which are compressed into X-Face header format using
  the compface software tools written and distributed by James Ashton
  <jaa@cs.su.oz.au>.  The compface library is also provided with the distri-
  bution of the faces software, written by Rich Burridge, and is available
  by email from his archive server <rb-archive-server@Aus.Sun.COM>.

  A non-imake version of a make file is provided as make.file.  You may
  use this file to build xmail, or invoke M.I.T.'s imake facility to
  generate a Makefile.  If you use the make.file instead, you must ensure
  that the proper environment is defined for your particular architecture
  and operating system.

  PLEASE report any bugs or enhancements to me at the address below, so
  changes can be incorporated in my sources and official patches posted.
