@begin(Q)
I get an error at runtime...
	Widget class XmMainWindow version mismatch (recompilation needed):
	widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled R4 Xt with R3 Xt include files
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I set UIDPATH, but my application can not find the right uid files.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You have to add %U at the end of the path. For example, if you want
to specify "/usr/users/x/uid", you say

	setenv UIDPATH /usr/users/x/uid/%U

The document says that you should append %N. It is wrong.

@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using an R3 Xt library.

In these cases (and some similar cases) it will be necessary to
trace through the directories indicated by the -I options to cc.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I get a SEGV in strlen().  I am calling XmString procedure with
XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET,
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled with 1.0 header files, and linked with 1.1 library
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
The first time I compile an application after building Motif, I get
a syntax error in Xm.h, around line 1969.  This line mentions
XtPointer.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using the R3 Xt .h files, probably because they are still
in /usr/include/X11.  You need to install the R4 .h files.  
@end(A)
