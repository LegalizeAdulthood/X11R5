What Is OLWM:
------------
Olwm (OpenLook window manager) is an ICCCM compliant window manager
supplied for use with the XView toolkit.  It requires the graphics
library, olgx, in the contrib/lib/i18nXView2/lib/libolgx section to
build.  Olwm is also dependent upon the OpenLook fonts found in the
contrib/lib/i18nXView2/fonts directory.  By default, these fonts are
already included in the FCS X Version 11 Release 4  and Release 5
distribution.  You will only need these fonts if you are using an older
version of the server.

A man page for olwm, olwm.man, can be found in this directory.  
A copy will also be installed in /usr/lib/X11/man.

Changes For This Release: 
------------------------  
This an internationalized version of olwm.  All text string for menus
of olwm are extracted and stored into message files.  By changing the
display language enviroment settings, olwm can dynamically change its
menus to displaying text of different languages.  For more information
on the usage and environment settings, please refer to olwm.man and
props.man in the installed area.
