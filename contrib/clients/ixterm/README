	INTERNATIONAL xterm

	Consists of 6 files: Imakefile, ictlseqs.ms, ixterm_isopatch
	                     README, ixterm.man, ixterm_patch.

	The ixterm source files will be created by running the command
	'patch <ixterm_patch' on the original xterm source files.


	The only difference between xterm and ixterm is that ixterm
	provides several national character replacement sets (NRCs)
	in the DEC VT102 emulation. These sets may be reached either
	through the resource database, the command line, scs sequences
	or by the extended font menu. The following nationalities are
	supported:


		Nationality		NRC Set

		North American		ASCII
		United Kingdom		United Kingdom
		Belgian			French
		Danish			Norwegian/Danish
		Dutch			ASCII
		Finnish			Finnish
		Flemish			French
		French			French
		French Canadian		French Canadian
		German			German
		Hungarian		Hungarian
		Italian			Italian
		Norwegian		Norwegian/Danish
		Portuguese		Portuguese
		Spanish			Spanish
		Swedish			Swedish
		Swiss			Swiss


	For those who use ISO fonts (as opposed to DEC fonts), problems
	will probably arise when using the characters 'currency' and
	'diaresis' (french and hungarian only). A patch is provided to
	fix this problem: Run the command 'patch <ixterm_isopatch' to
	make the necessary changes in the file data.c.

	See also the documents ixterm.man and ictlseqs.ms


	Good Luck!
