This source directory contains the code necessary to compile xtv.

Edit the IMakefile so the proper defines will be set for your machine type. 
The section of the IMakefile which contains commented portions for different
architectures is under the section ``USER DEFINABLE VARIABLES''
of the Makefile. The default is for Sun Sparcstations.


Create the Makefile from the Imakefile by typing: xmkmf
Then type: make depend
Finally type: make

That will compile the sources and build the xtv program.
To use xtv see xtv.man, xtv.qkref and xtv.guide. 
To know more about xtv see the files under paper.dir
