xco uses the database of standard X11 named colors to display name-color 
pairs.  Appearance is based on the X10 xcolors program.  To change the
foreground color, click the left mouse button in the color window you
want.  To change the background color, click the right mouse button in the
color window you want.  Clicking the middle mouse button sets the colors
back to the original foreground and background.  You can switch quickly 
through colors by holding down the left or right button and sliding the 
cursor through the colored windows.  More colors can be seen by clicking on 
the arrows at the bottom of the screen

Notes
=====
It reads the clients copy of the rgb database instead of getting the colors
from the server.

It is written using Xlib (before we fell in love with Xt).

Please feel free to send bug report/fixes and enhancements to me at the address
below.

Installation
============

If you have imake:
	"xmkmf"
	"make"

If you don't have imake
	Edit makefile.noimake and change RGBDATABASE (and the location of
	the X11 headers and libraries (if necessary)).
	"make -f makefile.noimake"
