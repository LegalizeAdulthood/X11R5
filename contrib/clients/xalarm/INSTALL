MAKING
~~~~~~

  First get any relevant patch files so as to make the latest patch version.
  You can find out which patch level your xalarm is at by looking at the file
  patchlevel.h in the source directory, or, if you have xalarm built, by:

% xalarm -version

  See the man page for more.  Apply any patches, see the patch files themselves
  for more information.

  If you have problems, have a look below.

    1.  If you don't want to use the Imakefile or the Makefile generated from
	    it, try using Makefile.alt.  First check it for correct flag
	    settings, then copy it to Makefile.
	Otherwise use the supplied Makefile, or check the Imakefile and
	    generate your own Makefile by "xmkmf".

	If you want to use a different notation or language for dates, see the
	    definitions for WEEKDAYS and MONTHS in xalarm.h.

    2.  First, "make config".  Answer the questions.

    3.  Try making with "make".  Have a play.

    4.  If you aren't installing (you selfish get), put the XAlarm.ad and
	    XAlarm.ad+ in your ~/.xresources file.
	Otherwise, try "make install", then "make install.man".

  Look at the manual for anything else & enjoy.


PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~

  Compilation

    1.  When using the Makefile generated from the Imakefile, compiler says
	things like, "Don't know how to make target `lib/Xaw/libXaw.a'".  You
	are not building in the contrib directory, so try removing $(DEPLIBS)
	from the xalarm target in the Makefile.

    2.  When using the Makefile generated from the Imakefile, the loader says
	things like, "ld: ./lib/Xaw/libXaw.a: No such file or directory".  You
	are not building in the contrib directory, so try re-defining
	LOCAL_LIBRARIES to be "-lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11" in the Makefile.

    3.  Compiler complains about gethostname().  If you haven't got this, you
	need to add -DNOGETHOSTNAME to DEFINES in the Makefile.

    4.  If you don't have "ps", "fgrep" or "colrm", you can compile xalarm, but
	you won't be able to use the -list option.  The command "ps" lists
	processes.  The command "fgrep" is a pattern matcher.  The command
	"colrm" removes everything from its input after the sixth column.  If
	you don't have this, you could possibly just use "tee" (giving its full
	path, of course) or equivalent which just replicates its input.  Look
	at the file config.1st.

    5.  Similarly, if you don't have "fortune" or "yow", you can't have
	"xfortune" or "xyow".


  Alarm Layout

    1.  You want to layout the alarm buttons differently, don't you?  Mine not
	good enough?  The buttons are within a Form Widget, so have a look at
	the Xaw man page for this.  Each button has the placement resources
	fromHoriz, fromVert, horizDistance & vertDistance.  There are some
	suggestions in the xalarm man page too.

	The button box and message label are also in a (higher level) Form
	widget, so you can also change the relationship of button box to
	message text.  See the man page too.

	Note that the ordering of resources are important; you can't refer to a
	widget in a resource before it's created by xalarm.  The order of
	creation is:

	    alarm:	buttonbox message
	    buttonbox:	quit snooze snooze1 snooze5 snooze15 snoozetime


BUGS
~~~~

  If you have any comments, suggestions, code, fixes, please let me know and I
  will make an attempt to include them.  A few ``things'' are mentioned in the
  bugs section of the manual.  Don't forget to include the xalarm version
  number ("xalarm -version" gives it you), machine/OS, X11 release & patch etc.
