Sat Oct  5 15:37:59 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-3.

Wed Oct  2 14:35:15 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Taken out the makeX and put that stuff in with config.1st, let the
	user sort it out.

Mon Sep 30 19:12:40 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -list so xalarm shows what ps thinks are the user's xalarm pids
	are.  Had to alter the makefiles so that you could set where ps & the
	rest where; added a config.1st to do this.

Sun Sep 29 22:16:09 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Made xalarm capable of parsing a file for alarms, so for regular
	times, it will set alarms automatically.

Fri Sep 27 10:43:41 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fed up with ``Is it only BSD that uses bzero, or only SYSV that uses
	memset?  Or is it a bit of both?''  Wrote my own.

Wed Sep 25 22:17:05 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Split README into README and INSTALL.  Made it all a touch more
	portable?  Thanks to Andreas Stolcke.  Made the manual more readable,
	thanks to suggestions by Bill Leonard.

Tue Sep 24 21:54:30 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added a -snooze & resource on suggestion by Bill Leonard, so you can
	have a default snoozetime already set for you.  Corrected bits & bobs
	in man page too.

Sun Sep 15 21:41:52 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Cleaned up for release in contrib for R5; re-named xalarm-3 for good
	measure.

	* Added a -reset kill & signal trapper code so that you can wake up an
	alarm and change the times.

Thu Sep  5 12:24:56 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added a make flag & fix for the X crash-on-zero-timeout (bug report
	from Jamie Zawinsk).  Cleaned up Makefile & README.

Mon Sep  2 11:54:20 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed the little problem with the clear button, although the resource
	still isn't changeable by the user.

Tue Aug 27 17:08:47 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* The timeout is now recalculated on confirmation so that if the time
	is absolute, messing around during confirmation won't result in a late
	alarm.

Wed Aug 21 18:00:00 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-2.00.

Tue Aug 20 10:25:58 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Fixed a little bug as a result of yesterday; if an invalid time is
	given with the noconfirm option, the alarm message text is "".

	* Finally made the popups get their geometry from the alarm, by
	intercepting it from the command line...

Mon Aug 19 13:56:53 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added xmemo (thanks to an unconnected posting by Dan Jacobson, I
	think) & found a bug in the manual - used -beep instead of -bell!!!
	Added -beep & -nobeep to options...

Sun Aug 18 11:17:45 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Put the toggling back (!) so you can fiddle with warning times too.

	* Changed -at and -in to -time, -in times preceded by a `+' (but
	warning times aren't).  None of that silly toggling etc.  Also made
	some options have shorter aliases.

	* Made xalarm overwrite any given message, so ps etc can't show what it
	is.  From a comment by Reiner Hammer.

Fri Aug 16 12:25:08 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Cleaned up here & there.

	* Incorporated a hacked version of the time parser from xcal-3.2, Peter
	Collinson et al.

	* Changed the way warnings are given.  No longer within quotes, they
	must be separated by commas (only).

Wed Aug 14 12:58:29 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected bug whereby time wasn't always correctly calculated when
	given as 12 hour clock but >12 hours ahead.

Tue Aug 13 12:41:32 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added forking - so must easier than I had assumed.  No closing to do
	after all.  Thanks to Gordon Freedman & Janet Anstett.

Fri Aug  9 13:38:35 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -h[elp].

Thu Aug  8 15:04:56 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added -v[ersion]; I'm fed up with getting bug reports without it.

	* Added a config to Makefile so as to make sure stuff is ready for
	making & running/playing with.

Mon Aug  5 15:46:00 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* It appears that stuff in .../lib/X11/app-defaults is not
	pre-processed with cpp, so we can't have "#ifdef" etc in there.  Moved
	colour stuff to separate file.  From Scott Blachovicz & a multitude of
	others.

Sun Aug  4 15:12:06 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Corrected bug whereby When?.when.label was for "at" time when it
	should be "in", when user gave invalid "in" time on the command line.

	* If enabled, confirmation is now always sort, unless alarm is to
	trigger immediately.

	* Made warnings only accept times in the [[[h]h]m]m format a` la -in.
	Invalid times result in an error message on stderr only.  Also added
	-nowarn.  (Implemented as "-warn 0" :-)

Fri Aug  2 09:46:42 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Added confirmation stuff to xalarm.  Does not confirm if using
	relative time given on the command line.  Also added -confirm,
	-noconfirm and -nobell.

	* Split up xalarm into more meaningful pieces.  Preparation for
	xalarm-2.00?

Wed Jul 31 13:20:29 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Released xalarm-1.01.

	* Made MakeX which looks for the absolute path of an executable.  Need
	it for yow, as it is often not is a person's path.

	* Fixed bug/mistake.  I had sometimes declared warg as an Arg, but
	XtSetValues expects an ArgList.  Changed to declare as warg[1].  From
	comments made by Dave Brooks, Bill Leonard & Braham Levy (plus more
	once our mailer came up).

	* Added 2 options; -bell and -warn "...".  By default the bell no
	longer sounds, and the warning times can be specified.  Both have
	resources of course.  From comments by Bill Leonard.

	* Updated the manual & made it clearer.

Tue Jul 30 10:29:22 1991  Simon Marshall  (sm at olympus)

	* Changed the way the time is calculated.  No more fiddling with
	strings & it's much more compact.

	* Added Imakefile, sent by Andreas Stolcke (stolcke@edu.Berkeley.ICSI).
	I don't know how useful it is, our imake isn't installed.

	* Changed default font for value entry to 9x15bold in XAlarm.ad; it is
	a little more readable.
