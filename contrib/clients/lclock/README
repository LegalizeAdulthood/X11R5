lclock -- Logo clock -- yet another clock demo

this requires R5 libraries and a server that supports SHAPE.

its been tested with NCDwm, uwm, twm, tvtwm, olwm and swm (including
swm's virtual desktop), and is happiest with those WM in that order:
NCDwm, uwm & twm don't get in its way at all, and olwm and swm (at
least the versions i have) don't understand SHAPE, so things don't look
right.

it shouldn't be too difficult to modify Clock.c to use any
logo as the clock face.  just replace the calls to XmuDrawLogo()
with another drawing routine.

Bugs:
Two of the inner sides have no border.  This is due to the
way XmuDrawLogo() calculates its polygons.
