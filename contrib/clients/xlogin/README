  This is the second release of xlogin! There has been a lot
of cleanup of the code and a few features have been added.
Please look at the manual page and the file CHANGES for more
information.

ABOUT:
------
  This program was written to do some stuff, which is no longer
done, when using Xdm from X Windows Version 11 (and not using sessreg).
It handles /etc/motd, /etc/nologin, user quotas (EPROCLIM, EUSERS),
/usr/adm/lastlog, /usr/adm/wtmp, /etc/utmp and $USER/.hushlogin.
You can even specify more than one "MOTD" file, using the -sysFiles
commandline option.
For more information see the manual page.
  I tried to write it as secure as possible (range checking in
strings etc.), but any further security hints are welcome.

COMPILING:
----------
  There are four compiler-flags: -DHOSTNAME, -DQUOTA, -DLASTLOGIN
  and -DHAS_NO_SETRE
o if you want the utmp host field to contain the hostname if the
  display string starts with ":", compile with -DHOSTNAME. This code
  is useful, if the utmp/wtmp is collected on a central machine.
o if you want lastlogin records to be written, use -DLASTLOGIN
o if you want to turn on the QUOTA code use -DQUOTA

ATTENTION!
o you *SHOULD* avoid setting -DHAS_NO_SETRE. This causes a possible
  security hole! If you don't have setreguid() or setreuid() functions,
  you have to specify "-userFiles /etc/motd" (e.g.) on the commandline
  in order to prevent users from reading protected files!

The program has been tested on the following machines:
   DecStation 2100,    Ultrix 3.1
   DecStation 3100,    Ultrix 3.1
   SunSparcStation 1,  SunOS 4.1.1

Enjoy!
