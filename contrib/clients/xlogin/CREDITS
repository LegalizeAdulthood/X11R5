  I would like to thank Elmar Bartel and Bernie Schneck here at
the TU for giving me some hints and helping me to make the code more
secure.

  Lotta thanks to Tim Theisen (tim@cs.wisc.edu or uwvax!tim) from the
Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
for doing the alpha and beta testing, supplying me with some code,
helping me with some design decisions and making the man-page look more
technical and correcting my English grammer and spelling. (I'm German,
as u can see from the signature ;-) ) Thank you!

Markus Weber <weber@informatik.uni-kl.de>
	for the bug-fix on file readability
