The Bargraph display widget shows a filled, colored rectangle.  The
level is specified by a floating point value between 0 and 1.
Bargraph is a slightly modified Scrollbar.

The class variable for the Bargraph display widget is
bargraphWidgetClass.

When creating a Bargraph widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database (in
addition to the common resources):

Name		Type		Default		Description

XtNlength	int		None		major dimension
XtNorientation	XtOrientation	XtorientVertical  orientation (vert or horiz)
XtNshown	float		NULL		percentage the thumb covers
XtNthickness	int		14		minor dimension
XtNthumb	Pixmap		Grey		thumb pixmap
XtNtop		float		NULL		level of bargraph
XtNfillColor	Pixel		black		filling color
XtNfillPixmap	Pixmap		NULL		filling pixmap

You can set the dimensions of the Bargraph two ways.  As for all
widgets, you can use the XtNwidth and XtNheight resources.  In
addition, you can use an alternative method that is independent of the
vertical or horizontal orientation:

XtNlength	Specifies the height for a vertical Slide and the width for
		a horizontal Bargraph

XtNthickness	Specifies the width for a vertical Slide and the height for
		a horizontal Bargraph

To create a Bargraph widget instance, use XtCreateWidget and specify
the class variable bargraphWidgetClass.

To destroy a Bargraph widget instance, use XtDestroyWidget and specify
the widget ID for the Bargraph.
