The Slide slider widget consists of a bargraph with an adjustable
floating point value between 0 and 1.  The value is changed by middle
clicking at the new point, or left or right adjustment through left or
right button clicks.  At any time, the bargraph displays the current
value.

The class variable for the Slide slider widget is slideWidgetClass.

When creating a Slide widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database (in
addition to the common resources):

Name		Type		Default		Description

XtNlength	int		None		major dimension
XtNorientation	XtOrientation	XtorientVertical  orientation (vert or horiz)
XtNshown	float		NULL		percentage the thumb covers
XtNthickness	int		14		minor dimension
XtNthumb	Pixmap		Grey		thumb pixmap
XtNtop		float		NULL		level of bargraph
XtNfillColor	Pixel		black		filling color
XtNfillPixmap	Pixmap		NULL		filling pixmap
XtNscrollProc	XtCallbackList	NULL		callback for incremental change
XtNscrollDCursor Cursor		XC_sb_down_arrow cursor for scrolling down
XtNscrollHCursor Cursor		XC_sb_h_double_arrow idle horiz cursor
XtNscrollLCursor Cursor		XC_sb_left_arrow cursor for scrolling left
XtNscrollRCursor Cursor		XC_sb_right_arrow cursor for scrolling right
XtNscrollUCursor Cursor		XC_sb_up_arrow	cursor for scrolling up
XtNscrollVCursor Cursor		XC_sb_v_double_arrow idle vert cursor
XtNthumbProc	XtCallbackList	NULL		callback for sliding change
XtNjumpProc	XtCallbackList	NULL		callback for sliding change,
						  but pass data by ref

You can set the dimensions of the Slide two ways.  As for all widgets,
you can use the XtNwidth and XtNheight resources.  In addition, you
can use an alternative method that is independent of the vertical or
horizontal orientation:

XtNlength	Specifies the height for a vertical Slide and the width for
		a horizontal Slide

XtNthickness	Specifies the width for a vertical Slide and the height for
		a horizontal Slide

To create a Slide widget instance, use XtCreateWidget and specify the
class variable slideWidgetClass.

The callback procedure for the slide area is:

void ScrollProc (cpick, client_data, position)
  Widget cpick;
  caddr_t client_data;
  int position;

cpick		Specifies the ID of the Slide
client_data	Specifies the client data
position	Returns the pixel position of the pointer in integer form

The ScrollProc callback is used for incremental change and for getting
feedback from the thumb and background.  The position argument is a
signed quantity.  Using the default button bindings, Button 1 returns
a positive value, and Button 3 returns a negative value.  In both
cases, the magnitudew of the value is the distance of the pointer from
the top (or left) of the Slide.  The value will never be greater than
the length of the Slide.

The callback procedure for the thumb area is:

void ThumbProc (cpick, client_data, percent)
  Widget cpick;
  caddr_t client_data;
  float percent;

cpick		Specifies the ID of the Slide
client_data	Specifies the client data
percent		Specifies the floating point fill values (0.0 - 1.0)

The ThumbProc callback is used to implement sliding change of value.
With the default button bindings, Button2 changes the value
interactively, and the ThumbProc is called on each new position of the
pointer.

It would be nice if microstepping (holding down the left or right
button results in continuous, fine adjustment of the value) were
implemented.  The Scrollbar widget also lacks this feature.

To destroy a Slide widget instance, use XtDestroyWidget and specify
the widget ID for the Slide.
