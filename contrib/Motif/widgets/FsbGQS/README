FsbGQS.c defines a function that automatically get the
selection text out of a FileSelectionBox and qualify it.
 
By default, when you get the text value in the selection area,
it is not qualified, and as a result, typing ~daniel/something
will not result in /u1/daniel/something, so you can just pass
the value to the file system as is.  

This should have been in 1.2 but somehow didn't make it, 
so here is it free.
