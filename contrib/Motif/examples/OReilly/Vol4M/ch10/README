xpixmap.c  This hardcodes a pixmap (displayed in a label)
	by invoking a converter from the application.  Since the Motif
	CvtStringToPixmap is not application accessible, the technique
    is demonstrated using the Athena widgets and the Xmu StringToBitmap
	converter.

xfallback.c	Defines a set of fallback resources.
