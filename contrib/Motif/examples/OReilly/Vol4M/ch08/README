xmotdbltst	Tests motion events and double clicks in the same 
   translation table.  Purpose is to show that this is erratic.

xtryaccel	Adds an XtInstallAccelerators call to xrowcolumn.  q and p keys 
   should invoke actions from anywhere in the application.  Note that
   this does not work in Motif because modifies translation and 
   accelerator tables internally.
