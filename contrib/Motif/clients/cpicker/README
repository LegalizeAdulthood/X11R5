    Pixedit is a tool for interactively modifying the X colormap.  It
    allows you to dynamically change the colormap cell for a specific
    pixel on the screen.  It works well for picking out one's desired
    colors, and then taking the hex RGB specification and putting it in
    one's .Xdefaults.

    There is a related program, cpicker, which displays a window's
    colormap and allows you to select and edit a particular cell.

    This Motif version uses Motif widgets and has an option, on by
    default, which tries to find the corresponding shadow colors
    in the colormap and change them at the same time.  This improves
    the overall appearance while interactively changing colors.
