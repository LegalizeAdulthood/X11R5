RUNNING WINTERP:
================

	0) First, you should compile WINTERP. See ./COMPILING for details.

	1) Once WINTERP has been compiled, start up the 'winterp' program
	in ./../src-server/winterp by running it in a terminal emulator
	window (xterm, hpterm, gnu-emacs' M-X shell). WINTERP will create
	windows and widgets when you ask it to, the results of evaluating 
	Winterp-Lisp language expressions will print to "standard
	output", and any XLISP, Motif, Xt, or X error messages will print
	to "standard error".

	See ./winterp.doc for X resources that you may want to set before
	starting up WINTERP. In particular, you should set resources
	"Winterp.lispInitFile" and "Winterp.lispLibDir" according to the
	directions given in the section of winterp.doc entitled
	"WINTERP Resources (~/.Xdefaults)".

	2) make sure you've installed the winterp client program
	'./winterp/src-client/wl' somewhere on your search path ($PATH).

	See ./winterp.doc sections entitled "Usage: the WINTERP-Lisp Unix
	Domain Socket client" for details on 'wl'.

	3) start up gnu-emacs. In gnu-emacs, load the emacs-lisp file
	./../src-client/winterp.el. (Use M-x load-file, or do
	(load "<pathname>/winterp") in your ~/.emacs file)

	See ./winterp.doc sections entitled 
	"Usage: the Gnu-Emacs programmers interface" for details.

	4) in gnuemacs, do find-file (^X^f) on one of the example programs
	in ./../examples/*.lsp: a good start might be the simple search
	browser	application built upon the unix 'grep' command --
	./../examples/grep-br.lsp'. See ./../examples/README for a 
	description of the example code provided in the WINTERP
	distribution.

	After visiting a *.lsp file, the buffer you're in should be in
	'lisp'-mode. Place the point somewhere within a lisp s-expression
	(aka, in between the opening and closing parentheses of a lisp
	statement), and hit C-M-X to send the expression you're pointing at
	to WINTERP. If you don't like hitting C-M-X, you can rebind the
	gnuemacs function winterp-send-defun to	a more accessible key.
	To send the current buffer being edited to WINTERP, you may use M-X
	winterp-send-buffer

	5) browse around  the various files in ./../examples and evaluate
	various forms.... The best way to see the power of combining Motif
	widgets with XLISP is via programming by example.

			--------------------

If you don't use gnuemacs, you can still send lisp input to WINTERP,
although it's much less elegant. While WINTERP is running inside a terminal
emulator, just use the 'wl' command to send forms to the lisp interpreter.
Assuming you either started WINTERP while cd'd to ./../examples, or
assuming that you set resource "Winterp.lispLibDir" to the examples
directory, you can then issue the following command to the shell
		wl '(load "grep-br")'
WINTERP will then load the file grep-br.lsp, and the grep search browser
application will appear momentarily.

			--------------------

Another way for non-emacs users to program in Winterp-Lisp is by using the
Winterp control panel, which is written in Winterp-Lisp. You should load
file ./../examples/w_ctrlpnl.lsp from your WINTERP initialization file.
For details on how to do that, see the section in winterp.doc that
documents resource "Winterp.lispInitFile". Just to try things out, you can
just load the control panel from the shell:
		wl '(load "w_ctrlpnl")'

w_ctrlpnl.lsp will give you a simple file-browser (based on the Motif
XmFileSelectionBox widget) that will allow you to load Winterp-Lisp files
into WINTERP.  You may also edit files in an editor (based on the Motif
XmText widget), and interactively send individual Winterp-Lisp expressions
off for evaluation using the "Eval @ Point" button. See
./../examples/README and ./../examples/w_ctrlpnl.lsp for details.
