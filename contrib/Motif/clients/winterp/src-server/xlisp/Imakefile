#
# Note on INCLUDES for Motif 1.0:
# ==============================
# Motif 1.0 does not use the standard X11r4 toolkit, therefore you must
# make sure that you are compiling Motif 1.0 programs with the headers
# associated with Motif 1.0, not the default headers that are used by
# X11r4 imake.
#
# Standard locations for Motif includes are /usr/include/X11 and
# /usr/include/Xm. Note that Motif 1.0 uses a variant of the X11r3 toolkit
# intrinsics headers which are installed in /usr/include/X11. Don't
# confuse these	with the incompatible Xtoolkit intrinsics from X11r4.
#
# IF YOUR INSTALLATION OF MOTIF PLACES THE INCLUDE FILES FOR MOTIF's Xt/Xm
# DIRECTORIES SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN cc's USUAL INCLUDE SEARCH PATH
# (normally -I/usr/include -I.), THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SET 'INCLUDES' BELOW
# TO THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION.
#
# If you change INCLUDES below, you should also set INCLUDES in 
# ../Imakefile.
#
# INCLUDES = -I/usr/include -I.

#
# Note on INCLUDES for Motif 1.1:
# ==============================
# Motif 1.1 uses the X11r4 Xlib, libXt, etc. Therefore imake should
# automatically point the compiler to the correct include file directory.
# Thus, leave imake's default TOP_INCLUDES alone, since that will point
# to the X11r4 headers.
# 
# Motif 1.1 is not included as part of the X11r4 distribution. 
# IF YOUR INSTALLATION OF MOTIF PLACES THE INCLUDE FILES FOR MOTIF's Xm
# DIRECTORIES SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN cc's USUAL INCLUDE SEARCH PATH
# (e.g. /usr/include/Xm), THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SET 'STD_INCLUDES' BELOW
# TO THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION.
#
# If you change STD_INCLUDES below, you should also set STD_INCLUDES
# in ../Imakefile. 
#			
# STD_INCLUDES = -I. -I/mnt0/src/OSFMotif1.1.1 -I/mnt0/src/OSFMotif1.1.1/X11

#
# Notes: 
#	If you just want to make a standalone XLISP interpreter, see the rule
#	"lisp::" in Makefile.{generic,hpux,sparc,...}.
#	
#	This Imakefile just creates libXlisp.a, which is used by ../winterp
#
#	libXlisp.a requires math library libm.a.
#
#	All changes made to XLISP for using in libXlisp.a for WINTERP
#       are within "#ifdef WINTERP" sections. Therefore, you MUST
#       define the preprocessor symbol WINTERP in compiling these
#	XLISP files.

# Note on DEFINES:
# (1) -DWINTERP: xlisp/xlisp.h and xlisp/xldmem.h (which are included by all
# WINTERP files) have '#ifdef WINTERP' surrounding changes made to XLISP
# for use by WINTERP: you MUST compile with -DWINTERP or nothing will work.
#
# (2) -D_NO_PROTO: this is required by Motif 1.1 if you are using a
# non-ANSI-C compiler. Eventually everybody will have an ANSI C compiler
# and at that point this flag should be removed.
#
# (3) -Dhpux is needed if you are running on HPUX 7.0.
#
# (4) -DMALLOC_0_RETURNS_NULL is needed on HPUX 7.0 when linking with
# the fast malloc library "-lmalloc".
#
# For HPUX 7.0, -Wc,-Np1000 is there to prevent the 'cc' error:
# 	"Parameter table overflow. Try the -Wc,-Np option."
# Get rid of this in HPUX 8.0 since the compiler is supposed to use
# dynamic tables.
# Note that the X11r4 Imake hp.cf specifies a smaller value of
# "-Wc,-Np" -- this setting overrides that value.
