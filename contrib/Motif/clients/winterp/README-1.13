WINTERP Version 1.13 -- X11r5 tape release

==============================================================================

WINTERP 1.13 is just a patch release over WINTERP 1.12 (see below):

	* Fixed SYSTEM // xlisp/unixstuff.c:Prim_SYSTEM
	  so that return value is a low-valued integer, same as returned
	  to shell.

	* Added TIMEOUT_ACTIVE_P // w_timeouts.c:Wto_Prim_TIMEOUT_ACTIVE_P
	  (Added to docs too)

	* Added GET_MOUSE_LOCATION // w_utils.c:Wut_Prim_GET_MOUSE_LOCATION
	  used by uunet!cimshop!rhess's menu server package.
	  (Added to docs too)

	* Fixed w_XmString.c:Get_String_or_XmString_Arg_Returning_XmString()
	  to print out correct error message if wrong type argument supplied
	  to function/method needing xmstring/string argument.

	* Fixed incorrect message name typo for XM_TEXT_FIELD_WIDGET_CLASS
	  method :SET_HIGHLIGHT, which was preventing :SET_CALLBACK
	  from working correctly on XM_TEXT_FIELD_WIDGET_CLASS.

	* Various other random fixes.

	* Added new demo programs, fixed and cleaned up existing ones, e.g:

		* grep-br.lsp: grep-based file search browser
			-- for Motif 1.1, new and improved search
			   browser functionality.

		* w_ctrlpnl.lsp: control panel, program editor for WINTERP.
			-- fixed problem with problems arising from
			   Motif1.1/X11r4 recursive event loop bug.
			   Unfortunately the fix requires that your
			   WINTERP be running an eval-server, and that
			   'wl' is on your path... See doc/BUGS for the
			   full story.

		* man-br.lsp: simple manual page browser.
			-- Browse 'cat' manual pages in a particular
			   directory. (I use this to browse Motif 'cat' 
			   manpages while programming Motif in WINTERP).

	* new entries in contrib directory:

		* WINTERP-based menu server package:
		  "The menu server allows the user to create menu's in a
		  "menu cache" and then pop them up when needed by calling
		  the  WINTERP menu server with the menu's "key".  This
		  allows for the creation of a collection of re-usable menus
		  for such things as command menus in GNU emacs or menu
		  driven shell scripts. Any menu in the server can be
		  accessed thru either the GNU or Perl interface (you just
		  need to know the menu's "key")."

		* GNU Emacs extension providing automatic name completion
		  on WINTERP/Motif names, automatic lookup in WINTERP
		  documentation. Better handling of winterp.doc using
		  Emacs' "Thinktank-like" outline and rolodex mode.
		  (Courtesy of Bob Weiner, rsw@cs.brown.edu)

		* Patches for compiling on Sun 3/60, SunOS 3.5,
		  OSF/Motif 1.1. Didn't integrate this patch because 
		  I don't expect anybody to be using SunOS 3.5.
		  (Courtesy of Richard Hess, cimshop!rhess@uunet.uu.net)

		* Patches to replace BSD Inet/Unix domain server with
		  SysVish TLI -- for Sequent's DYNIX/ptx 1.2.0.
		  (Courtesy of Dave Wolfe, wolfe@sybase.com).

		* Patches to GNU Emacs interface to WINTERP:
		  added winterp-send-area, winterp-send-region;
	          modified  winterp-send-buffer, and winterp-send-defun.
		  (Courtesy of Dave Wolfe, wolfe@sybase.com).

Subject: Announcing WINTERP release 1.12 (for Motif 1.1 and 1.1.1)
==============================================================================

WINTERP 1.12 is a minor patch release over WINTERP 1.11 -- it corrects a
few simple source bugs that appeared when porting to non-HP platforms. This
release should work on most hardware and software platforms. WINTERP 1.12
has been tested on the following platforms:
        * HP9000s3xx (68030/68040) running HPUX 7.0, HPUX 6.5.
        * HP9000s8xx (HP's PA-RISC) running HPUX 7.0, HPUX 3.1.
        * HP9000s7xx (HP's PA-RISC 1.1) running HPUX 8.0
        * Sun Sparc 2 running SunOS Release 4.1.1
        * Data General AViiON (m88k, DG/UX 4.30, GNU C 1.37.23)
        * DECStation 3100 running Ultrix.
	* SGI 4D ("MIPS, SGI Unix, latest release (Cypress)")

I've received reports that previous versions of WINTERP have run on the
following:
        * IBM RS6000 AIX 3.1
        * Sun 3 running SunOS 4.0.3
        * MIPS (Mips RS2030)
        * Intel System Vr3.2 v2.2 (using Intel X11R3 with Intel Motif v1.0.A and TWG/TCP v3.1)
        * Apollo's 680xx machines.

Release 1.11 and 1.12 feature (briefly):
        * Support for most of the new functionality of Motif 1.1 and 1.1.1
        * Support for some of the new functionality of X11r4
        * Source is #ifdef'd to automatically compile with Motif 1.1/1.1.1
          or 1.0.
        * Lots of new & nifty example and test programs.
        * Various bug fixes and code cleanup.
        * Added a number of missing Motif resources, methods, etc.
        * Better portability -- I've tried to accomodate all the
                patches and changes people have suggested in order to
                allow WINTERP to compile on a variety of machines.
        * Imakefiles corrected and updated to X11r4.
        * Makefile.generic, Makefile.hpux, Makefile.sparc -- a generic
          makefile system for those that don't want to bother with Imake.
        * The TCP/IP eval server is now a compilation option, a Unix Domain
          socket is used by default. This means that running WINTERP is 
          no longer a security hole. The TCP/IP server seemed to be a 
          big portability problem -- hopefully the Unix Domain socket
          version will be more portable.
        * TCP/IP and Unix Domain Socket servers can be enabled/disabled
          via X resources. Verbosity of evaluation messages output can also
          be reduced via X resource options. These options are useful for
          people building stand-alone applications on top of WINTERP. 
        * Entering XLISP break-loop on Xlib errors, XtWarnings, and
          XtErrors is optional. This allows applications delivered in 
          WINTERP to behave more like normal Xtoolkit programs. 
        * More and Better documentation.
        * Various emacs-lisp functionality added in "contrib" directory,
          courtesy of Bob Weiner of Brown University. (I Haven't had time
          to integrate or test this software yet).
        * etc, etc, etc.

Note that I've mainly tested WINTERP 1.12 on HPUX 7.0 running on HP9000s3xx
(Motif 1.0, Motif 1.1, Motif 1.1.1, and HP UEDK Motif 1.1); I've done a
little bit of testing on an HP9000s8xx machine, but only with Motif 1.0.
I've also briefly tested on an HP9000s7xx (Snakes series) machine running
HPUX 8.0 and HP UEDK Motif 1.1. I've also tested it on a Sun Sparc 2
running SunOS Release 4.1.1 and Motif 1.1.1. 

I've received reports from Victor Kan (Data General Corporation) that this
version of WINTERP compiles and seems to run ok on a Data General AViiON
(m88k, DG/UX 4.30, GNU C 1.37.23).
