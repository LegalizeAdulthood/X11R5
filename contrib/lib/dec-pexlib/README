This is PEXlib from Digital.

The are 2 directories beneath directory 'dec_pexlib':

	'src'     - contains source, an Imakefile, a compressed postscript doc,
		    a Makefile for Digital, and Digital specific include files 

		  This Imakefile was tested to generate a Makefile
		  that built a pexlib on a DEC, HP, and SUN at the X 
		  Consortium.

		  This directory contains a little script to compile and link 
		  a test file named 'cube.'  cube.c and pst_colormap.c are
		  required to generate image 'cube'. 


	'include' - the other header files

		Header files in this area vary from modified header
		files from the X Window System Software Release 5 to digital 			specific MPEX*.h header files.

		Updated PEX-SI include files are:

			PEXlibint.h - includes X include correctly

			PEXprotost.h -  includes X include correctly
