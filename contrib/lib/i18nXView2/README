Introduction
------------
The intention of this donation is to test the callback mechanism  
specified in
    "X Window System, Version 11 
     Input Method Specifications
     Post-Public Review Draft 1.1 - proposed"
Please refer to Environment/Dependency section for the tested
environment and dependency. This donation is meant to be a sample
implementation, NOT a fully supported product.  
Follow-on donations and support are NOT to be assumed.  Binary and
source compatibility with existing and future SunSoft products are also
NOT to be assumed.

1.  An i18n version of XView provides on-the-spot input style
    and callback support.  In addition, it provides a default set of
    lookup choice and auxiliary callbacks.  All of the default
    callbacks can be overridden by using XView API to interpose
    customized callbacks if desired.  This donation of libxview is
    intended to work with callback supported XIM only.  In addition, it
    requires Sun's extensions defined in <X11/XSunExt.h>, which
    includes the data structures and definitions for lookup choice and
    auxiliary callbacks, and IC values of Sun's extensions.

Environment/Dependency:
----------------------
The required environment for building and running this donation

  o  MIT X11R5 or OpenWindows 2.X or JOWN2.X
  o JLE1.1.1(SunOS4.1.1 based) RevA or later version
  o libmle.so.1.4 or later.  
    This could be found in  JOWN2.0.1 RevB and later version.
  o MIT X11R5 Xlib compiled with "BuildXimp" flag.
  o Htt IM server.
	
This release is only tested with the bundled JLE C compiler and above
environment in japanese locale.  No other environment is tested and
supported at this point.  This donation does not guarantee any binary
and source compatibility with future release of XView.

For more information on Htt IM server please refer to
$(TOPDIR)/contrib/im/Ximp/sun/Htt/README


Building the donation:
---------------------
TOPDIR is the root of the MIT X11R5 source tree.

Before building the Sun's donation, an Ximp version of Xlib must
be built.  This could be done by 
	o  adding #define BuildXimp YES
	   to the top of $(TOPDIR)/mit/config/sun.cf
		and
	o  changing #define BuildXimp to YES 
	   and #define BuildXsi to NO in 
	   $(TOPDIR)/mit/lib/X/Imakefile
	   $(TOPDIR)/mit/lib/nls/Imakefile  
	
Then type "make" in $(TOPDIR)/mit/lib/X,
and install this Xlib into the target installation directory.  


To build & install XView and clients and man pages.  
        In $(TOPDIR)/contrib/lib/i18nXView2
	1.  Type "make Makefiles" for building all Makefiles 
	2.  Type "make" for building the world
	3.  Type "make install" for installation
	    NOTE: This istall must be done after installing X11R5 core.
	4.  Type "make install.man" for installation of man pages

To build & install olwm.  
        In $(TOPDIR)/contrib/clients/i18nOlwmV2
        1.  Type "make Makefile" for building the Makefile 
	2.  Type "make" for building olwm
	3.  Type "make install" for installation


Running the donation:
--------------------
1.  Copy $(TOPDIR)/contrib/lib/i18nXView2/Xinitrc to 
    $(HOME)/.xinitrc
2.  If default install directory is changed, then
    modify INSTALL_ROOT in .xinitrc to point at the correct place.
3.  Then run the command "xinit -- Xsun" 

Feedback Mechanisms:
-------------------
This is a sample implementation which is NOT meant to be product
quality.  No support is provided.  It is a proof of concept prototype
of the "on-the-spot" user interface style using callbacks.  We are
interested in feedback on this prototype.

Topics of general interest and questions about usage can be sent to
comp.windows.x, comp.windows.open-look or the xpert mailing alias, but
we would prefer to have them go to i18nxview-si@sun.com.

If you do not have an email connection, feedback may be faxed to
(415) 969-9131 or telexed to 3729639 SUN UR.  Please put the
following on the cover sheet of the fax or telex.
