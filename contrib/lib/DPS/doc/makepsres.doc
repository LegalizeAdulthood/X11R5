Makepsres is an application to create PSres.upr files.  These files are used
by the font selection panel and by other Adobe software to locate fonts and
other PostScript resources; these resources can then be loaded into a printer
or Display PostScript system for use by page descriptions or applications.

For a description of PSres.upr files, see PSres.doc

makepsres [options] directory ...

makepsres creates a PSres.upr file containing all the resources in all the
directories on the command line.  If the list of directories contains "-",
stdin is read and assumed to be a space-, tab-, or newline- separated list of
directories.  If the list of directories is empty, it is taken to be ".".  If
all specified directories have a common initial prefix, makepsres extracts it
as a directory prefix in the PSres.upr file.

makepsres normally acts recursively; it looks for resource files in
subdirectories of any specified directory.  This can be overridden with the
command line option -nr.

makepsres uses existing .upr files to assist in resource typing.  Its
normal mode of operation is to create a new PSres.upr file containing

  1. Resource files found in the directories on the command line,
  2. Resource files pointed to by PostScript resource database files in the
  directories on the command line, and
  3. Resource entries found in the input PostScript resource database
  files.  These entries are copied whenever the files they specify still
  exist and are located in directories not specified on the command line.

There are two other modes.  If run in "discard" mode, makepsres does not copy
resource entries from the input PostScript resource database files; the
output file consists solely of entries from the directories on the command
line.  The input PSres.upr files are only used to assist in identifying
files.  If run in "keep" mode, makepsres includes in the output file all
resource entries in the input PSres.upr files, even entries for files that no
longer exist or are located in directories specified on the command line.

The normal way to invoke makepsres is simply
	makepsres
It is expected that installation scripts will invoke makepsres
automatically, thereby avoiding the user's being aware of this whole effort.

Options:
	-o filename
		Writes the output to the specified filename.  -o - writes
		to stdout.  If the -o option is not specified, makepsres
		creates a PSres.upr file in the current directory.

	-f filename
		Uses the specified file, which must be in PostScript resource
		database file format, as information to assist resource
		typing.  Multiple -f options may be specified.  -f - uses
		stdin as an input file and may not be used if - is specified
		as a directory on the command line.

	-dir filename
		Specifies that the filename is a directory.  Needed only if
		the directory name would be confused with an option.

	-e	Marks the resulting PSres.upr file as exclusive.  This makes
		the associated subroutines run more quickly since they do not
		have to look for other .upr files; however, makepsres must be
		run whenever new resources are added to the directory, even
		if the resources come with their own .upr file.

	-i	Specifies interactive mode.  In interactive mode, the user
		will be queried for the resource type of any encountered
		file that makepsres cannot identify.  If -i is not specified,
		makepsres assumes an unidentifiable file is not a resource
		file.

	-q	Be quiet:  do not warn about unidentifiable files, just
		ignore them.

	-nr	Specifies non-recursive.  If -nr is present makepsres does not
		look in subdirectories for resource files.

	-nb	If the output file already exists, do not back it up.

	-s	Specifies strict mode.  If -s is present makepsres
		terminates with an error when encountering an unidentifiable
		file.

	-p	Specifies no directory prefix.  If -p is present, makepsres
		does not try to find a common directory prefix among the
		specified directories.

	-d	Specifies discard mode.

	-k	Specifies keep mode.

makepsres uses various heuristics to type files.  A file that is of a
private resource type or that does not conform to the standard format for a
resource file can be:
	- Identified by the user by running makepsres in interactive mode,
	- Preloaded into a PostScript resource database file used for input, or
	- Begin with the line
		%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-<resource-type>
