WHAT IT IS

libXO - O'Neal X Library

This is a library of X and Xt-based convenience routines. They are
generally intended to work with any Xt-based widgets. Most of the
development to date has been with the Athena widgets set from MIT,
but the routines should work in any Xt-based application.


HOW TO INSTALL IT

If you have imake, make the Makefile in the manner normal for your
environment (typically via xmkmf).  Otherwise, use Makefile.STD.

make install

will build and iinstall it.


If you add features or fix bugs, please the diffs!  Likewise, I am
open to suggestions - they may or may not make it, but you might
as well try!
