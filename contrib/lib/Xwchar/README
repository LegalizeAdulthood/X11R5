			Xwchar Library

This library is to support the wide character set -- process codeset
which is used for data processing internally in program, not opened to
user.  The data type reflecting the process codeset is wchar_t and
implemented firstly for X window system, so that the library is called
Xwchar library.

We define the data type of wchar_t to be the wide 4-byte, not as
usually 2-byte[JLER91, JLEP91].  The reason is to make wchar to be
capable for supporting multilingual data processing, not only for
couple of languages(English plus one Eastern language usually).  The
encoding of 4-byte form is defined with respect to the canonical form
of ISO DIS 10646(UCS) [D10646]. 

All functions of the library is classified majorly to three fields:
Code Classification(iswcntrl()...), Code Conversion(wcstombs()...)
and String Manipulation(wcscpy()...).  Most of these functions are
defined in ANSI C Multibyte Support[MSE91a], some are creative(atowc(),
iswblank()...) which are used often in the implementation of X i18n.
Maybe ANSI C forgets to include them. :-)


To build Xwchar you should use the following commands:

	% cd Xwchar
	% xmkmf <Topdir> <Curdir> (you may set Topdir and Curdir)
	% make includes
	% make depend
	% make all

After building, It can be installed in your local bin using:

	% make install

Enjoy it!
