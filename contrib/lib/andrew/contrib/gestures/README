After seeing the Gesture Package developed by Dean Rubine*, I decided
that Andrew needed an interface for gestures.  I put together this
simple text object that uses a few hand-made gestures to cut, copy,
paste, scroll, and set the dot.

3.0 Comments:

	I think this is an interesting type of interface, fast and efficient. 
If you have any additions to gtextv, please send them to me.  I created
this template textview object so that others could build on it, taking a
lot of load off me.  Well, have fun.
