This directory contains mrecord, a simple program from recording mouse gestures

An example use is given in gdprec, which records the gestures for the gdp
program:

	for i
	in line rect copy Rotate delete pack ellipse #Dot move
	do
		mrecord -s -o gdp.train -c $i
	done


The -s option means each gesture is a single stroke (and should be the
default but isn't).  Each invocation to mrecord records examples of a single
gesture class, which is given via the -c option.  The -i option specifies
the output file; it's usually a .train or .test file.

I usually record about fifteen examples of each class.  The gestures are made
with the left button, and the right button quits the program.

   A note on training:
      At first, within a class, use examples that are all pretty similar,
      especially in orientation, but in size as well.  After you prove to
      yourself that the recognition works, you can experiment, varying the
      size and/or orientation of the training examples and see how the
      recognizer performs.  A little variation in the training examples is
      essential to good recognition; otherwise variations in the test examples
      may cause misclassifications.

    The siggraph paper and the usenix paper show some gestures that work for
    gdp.  In case you don't have the paper handy, here's a description of
    the gestures I usually use.  (The paper has pictures, which are easier
    to understand than these descriptions.)

	line	a rightward segment
	rect	an ```L''
	copy 	a ``C''
	Rotate	a loop, much like a script ``n''
	delete  a ``X'' made with a single stroke (i.e. three segments)
	pack	a counterclockwise circle, starting and ending at ``noon''
	ellipse an upward stroke followed by a counterclockwise circle
	.dot	pressing the button without moving
	move	a rightward arrow (right segment followed by a short
		  leftward,downward segment)
