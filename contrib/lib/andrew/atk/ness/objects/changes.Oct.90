\bold{Changes to Ness released October 12, 1990}


These changes correspond to Ness version 1.5.  (ness.ch)  File names in 
parentheses indicate files changed to affect the change.  


Note to maintainers:  With this revision two files are no longer part of the 
distribution and should be explicitly deleted: ness/objects/yypshpop.c and 
ness/objects/nesscomp.h.


\heading{New feature}


Added functions regSearch and regSearchReverse to do regular expression 
pattern matching in both directions.  The search algorithms are the same as 
those used for the search commands in ez.  (search.c, ../doc/nessfunc.d)


\heading{Improvements}


Revised the implementation of search() to be much faster, based on the 
simplest of Daniel Sunday's algorithms in the August 1990 CACM. (search.c)


\heading{Bugs corrected}


Added a NotifyObservers call in value_SetArrayElt().  Now when the latter is 
called the clicklistV--or other observer of the value--will display the 
modified string.  (nevent.c)


Fixed a syntax error in calc.d.


\heading{Machine independence}


Revised the getc/ungetc code in ness__ReadNamedFile to try to make it work on 
PMAX and Sun4.   (ness.c)


Eliminated the dependency on the local version of Yacc.  Previously 
recursively compilation required a messy routine to save the state of the 
compilation as retained in yaccpar, which was automatically inserted in the 
code by yacc.  Since diferent platforms have different yaccpars, the state was 
not saved correctly on some systems.  Two steps were taken to correct the 
problem.  First, nesscomp.c is distributed as well as nesscomp.gra so Ness can 
be recompiled without running yacc.  Second a special version of yaccpar was 
written which has no global variables so no state needs to be preserved.  (The 
new version also has no goto's!)  (nesscomp.gra, nesscomp.c, call.c, dump.c, 
gen.c, error.c, ness.c, gen.hn, Imakefile, tokens/yaccpar, tokens/buildy.c, 
tokens/reyacc.c, tokens/Imakefile, \bold{NOTE: yypshpop.c and nesscomp.h are 
no longer part of Ness})


Cosmetic code changes


Changed the implementation of the Ness function value_SetArraySize to use the 
C function value_SetStrArrayAndSize, so changes to value.c will not adversely 
affect Ness functions.  (nevent.c)


Changed MapRunError so its argument is a ness instead of an errornode.  This 
was necessary as an indirect result of the elimination of the global 
ErrorList. (error.c, error.h, call.c, nevent.c, ness.c)
