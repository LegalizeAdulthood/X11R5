\chapter{ATK Documentation Library}



Documentation on ATK is divided into 1) an overview document and related 
general documents, 2) modules describing each class, 3) tutorial modules 
discussing example programs, and 4) help files. 


ATK programmers should read the overview.doc and progenv.doc files for general 
information on working with ATK.  These files are stored in the same directory 
as this file, and are installed in $DESTDIR/doc/atk/doc (ask your site 
administrator for the location of $DESTDIR).   The example programs and 
discussions in $DESTDIR/doc/atk/examples will also be useful.


Modules describing each class and help files are stored along with the 
corresponding code.  Therefore the document view.doc will be found in 
atk/basics/common along with view.ch and view.c.  All documents are installed 
in the corresponding directories in $DESTDIR/doc/atk.  All help files are 
installed in $DESTDIR/help and can be accessed through the help system.


A hardcopy version of the library set (which includes figures for the overview 
and examples) is available from the Information Technology Center.  Refer 
orders to the distribution center care of:
