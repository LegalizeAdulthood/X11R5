	This version of the Graphlib Library is to be superseeded by a 
version which will be written in C++.  This is because we have determined
that it is impossible to write the library in anything approximating a
reasonable manner.  The primary location in which this occurs is GL_Create.
I decided it would be useful to be able to create the lists passed to 
GL_Create on the fly.  However, this is not possible under the current 
implementation, and in C it would look like a hack to make it possible.
However under C++, the , operator can be used to build lists, and this
is what we are going to do.  This version was distributed because it has
useful clients on it.  I will continue to support this version until the
new version completely superseeds all of the functionality of this one.
You may contact me to find out how the progress on the new library is going,
and if you are interested to recieve alpha test versions.
	The authors hope that you enjoy the library, and find it useful
in building X applications.  More information on the authors can be found
in the file Authors.
