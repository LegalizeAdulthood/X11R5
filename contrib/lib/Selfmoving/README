This is the Selfmoving widget distribution. The Selfmoving widget has been designed to be used by programmers who have to write applications in which the user shoud be able to move, to resize, to delete and to align others widgets.


ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find in this distribution:


- Imakefile   : The imake file that will be used to build the distribution on a
                X11R5 site. (See building instructions below)
 
- Se          : The directory containing the Selfmoving widget code. For more 
                details read the README file in this directory.

- Athena_demo : This directory contains a demo programming using the Selfmoving
                widget with the Athena widget set.

- Motif_demo  : This directory contains a demo programming using the Selfmoving
                widget with the OSF/Motif widget set.

- Doc         : This directory contains a user's guide to the Selfmoving widget
                


BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have installed X11R5 on your machine you can compile the Selfmoving widget and the Athena demo program in the following way:

  1) cd to the top of the Selfmoving distribution (The directory where you found
     this file)

  2) Type: xmkmf -a
     This will build all Makefiles in the distribution.
     Furthermore this step will create the ./X11/Se directory structure and
     create the ./X11/Se/SelfM.h and ./X11/Se/SelfMP.h include files.

  3) Type: make
     This will compile the Selfmoving widget and the Athena demo program
     This step will create the SelfM.o and libSe.a files in ./Self
     It will create the aw_demo.o and aw_demo files in ./Athena_demo.

Before running the aw_demo program in the ./Athena_demo directory you should
set your XENVIRONMENT variable to point to the full path of the aw_demo.dat
resource file in ./Athena_demo  or at least type: aw_demo -g 300X300


WARNING: To build the demo program in ./Motif_demo follow the instructions given
         in the README file in that directory.


INSTALLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the Selfmoving library and include files type:

  - make install
you must have the proper priveleges to do that


This will 

- add Se/libSe.a in your X11R5 library directory 

- add  X11/Se/SelfM.h and X11/Se/SelfMP.h in your X11R5 include directory
