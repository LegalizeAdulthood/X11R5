This directory contains a demo program using the Selfmoving widget with
Athena widgets


ROADMAP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find in this directory:


- Imakefile   : The imake file that will be used to compile the demo program
                on a X11R5 site. 
 
- aw_demo.c   : The demo program source file

- aw_demo.dat : The resource file for the demo program


                

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If X11R5 is installed on your machine you should follow the instructions given
in the README file in the Selfmoving directory.

If X11R5 is not installed or you do not want to use Imake you shoud do the 
following things:

- copy aw_demo.c, aw_demo.dat, ../Se/SelfM.c, ../Se/SelfM.h, ../Se/SelfMP.h
  in one directory and try to compile it


WARNING: Before running the aw_demo program you should set the 
         XENVIRONMENT variable to the full path of the aw_demo.dat resource
         file.
         Or at least run aw_demo with: aw_demo -g 300X300 for example
