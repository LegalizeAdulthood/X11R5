To quickly play a game to see how xhearts works, simply do the following:
(I'm assuming you know how to play "hearts")

    1) Edit the file "players" so that the 2nd line is the same as $DISPLAY

    2) ./xhearts

For multi-human games, please see the manual.  BUT, it may not work.
It didn't use to do this, but after patching up a couple "unrelated"
bugs, the program here gives "Bad Font" errors when multiple displays
are used.  Unfortunately, it looks as though I'll have no time in the
foreseeable future to track this bug down.  I've looked into it a bit,
but I couldn't make any headway.  I'd certainly be very beholden to
anybody who fixed this!

The following are potentially useful .Xdefaults or XHearts.ad entries:

    xhearts.wlm:		(LIBDIR/hearts)
    xhearts*font:		timR18
    *bitmapFilePath:		(if the four suit bitmaps installed 
				 in other than INCDIR/bitmaps)
    xhearts.logFile		(any pathname)

If you would like to help me improve the computer strategy, please
set the log file active, either with the resource or the -log flag.
Then, if you see the computer do something dumb, you can mail me the
last few hundred lines of the log file along with an explanation of
why you think my program is a bozo.  On very, very rare occasions,
the computer may actually make an illegal play.  Needless to say,
I am especially interested in these.  You will know this happened
if the cards from the previous trick are still visible when it is
your play.
