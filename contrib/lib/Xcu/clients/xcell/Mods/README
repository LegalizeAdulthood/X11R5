Mod files are used to make single index perturbations of a rule.

All possible perturbations of a rule such that only one number is changed
are listed.

The file is then padded with null perturbations so that there is a factorable
number of entries.

The first number of the file is the number of entries.

The second and third numbers are the number of columns and number of rows
to use.

The rest of the file are the perturbations.

The names of the files are "reduct_spread", i.e., the number of possible
states in the rule, underbar, the number of possible results that are
reduced to the states via the rule.


Thus, the lcr4 rule uses "4_10".
