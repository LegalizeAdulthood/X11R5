This directory contains the source for the XVPS extension to the
XView toolkit.  XVPS is a postscript extension to XView.  It allows
rendering postcript into a canvas.  It requires the X11/NeWS server and
the cps program which comes with OpenWindows.  If you have neither,
this source is a good example of how to subclass a new object off
an existing toolkit object.  For more info on subclassing see
the XView Programming Manual from O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.  Chapter
22.
