SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     Suspending a cmdtool with control-Z kills it.
Public Summary:
	Starting up cmdtool, then hitting control-Z, the cmdtool is killed.
Work Around:
	Background dbxtool in the beginning

		ex: dbxtool lex &

	USER-LEVEL WORK-AROUND (for existing tools):
	A general user-level work-around in csh would be:

	alias TOOL '$OPENWINHOME/bin/TOOL \\!* &'

	where TOOL is cmdtool, shelltool, dbxtool, etc.

	SYSTEM-LEVEL WORK_AROUND (for existing tools):
	A system-level work-around is to create a "launcher" for
	each tool.  Each user, then, doesn't have to create aliases.

	Overview:
	Create a directory to contain the launched applications.  Copy or link
	each application into this directory.  Build a simple launcher for each 
	application.

	Copy this file to launcher.c:

	/*
 	*  A launcher for an existing tool that simply backgrounds the tool
 	*/
	 
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <sys/param.h>
	#include <errno.h>
	 
	#define TOOL            "cmdtool"
	 
	/************ INSTRUCTIONS *************
	 
    	(These instructions are for "cmdtool"; replace as appropriate)
	 
    	1. Become the user that installed OpenWindows (on the machine
        	where OpenWindows is installed).
       	% rlogin owhost  (for example)
       	% su root        (for example)
	 
    	2. Make sure the environment variable OPENWINHOME is properly set.
       	% echo $OPENWINHOME
	 
    	3. Make a directory to contain the original tools.
       	% mkdir $OPENWINHOME/bin/origtools
	 
    	4. Copy the tool to the origtools directory
       	% cp $OPENWINHOME/bin/cmdtool $OPENWINHOME/bin/origtools
	 
    	5. Copy this file (launcher.c) to a new file
       	% cp launcher.c /tmp/cmdtool.c
       	% cd /tmp
	 
    	6. Define TOOL to be "cmdtool" in this file (if necessary, see above)
       	(Use an appropriate editor)
	 
    	7. Build and test the launcher (should background itself and come up)
       	% cc -o cmdtool cmdtool.c
       	% /tmp/cmdtool
	 
    	8. Install the launcher (if test passes)
       	% chmod 755 /tmp/cmdtool
       	% mv /tmp/cmdtool $OPENWINHOME/bin
	 
    	Notes:
       	To uninstall, simply move the original tool back to $OPENWINHOME/bin.
       	% mv $OPENWINHOME/bin/origtools/cmdtool $OPENWINHOME/bin
       	% rmdir $OPENWINHOME/bin/origtools   (if all tools uninstalled)

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     shelltool erroneously erases characters
Public Summary:
	When editing in a shelltool with vi, it is common for shelltool
	to screw up the display and erase characters from the display
	that really exist in the file.  This has caused numerous editing
	mistakes, making shelltool unusable for editing.
Work Around:
	A refresh of the screen gets the text back.

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     ttyselection is created with world write permissions and generic name
Public Summary:
	ttyselection is created with world write permissions and generic name.
	This causes two problems:

	- other users are allowed to overwrite your selection

	- If multiple instances of OpenWindows are run, you may end up with 
	someone else's selection.
Work Around:
	Add the following lines to /etc/rc after the line 
	'(cd /tmp; rm -f - *)':

    	touch /tmp/winselection /tmp/ttyselection
    	chmod 000 /tmp/winselection /tmp/ttyselection

	this turns off copy and paste. Since the copy command recreates
	/tmp/ttyselection with mode 666, you can't configure it per user.

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     cmdtool will not allow <CTRL>-e to be passed on
Public Summary:
	Start a cmdtool, type <CTRL>-E, the command is not echo'ed.  But, if
	you then type "rlogin `hostname`" in the cmdtool, and type <CTRL>-E,
	the command will be echo'ed to the tool.

Synopsis:     Shelltool core dumps when started with parameters
Public Summary:
	Start shelltool with following parameters and after a few seconds it 
	dumps core.  

	shelltool -WP 1086 280 -Wp 650 600 -Wi -Ww 500 -Wh 550 -Wl "asdf"

	Move the shelltool so that you can see its bottom edge and it will 
	eventually dump core.

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     cmdtool scroll buffer grows forever, exhausting swap space
Public Summary:
	The cmdtool scroll buffer limit is not set by default, causing cmdtools
	that have run for a long time to grow huge.  This can eventually lead to
	complete exhaustion of swap space, which kills the server.

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     can't change directory when storing cmdtool history log
Public Summary:
	When running a cmdtool (scroll bars enabled), having some problems
	with the "History> Store Log as New File" operation.  When the 
	"Text:Store" dialogue box comes up, trying to change the 
	"Directory:" line to /tmp, since don't want to save the file in
	home directory.  Then enter a filename on the "File:" line and hit
	the "store as new file" button.  The result of this is a dialogue
	box that says:

		Cannot Change Directory
		Change Directory Has Been Disabled
		<confirm>

	There doesn't appear to be any documentation on how to change this
	option.  Don't even know how OW environment got into this state.

SubCategory:  cmdtool                         
Synopsis:     Cmdtool comes up without character echoing
Public Summary:
	In several instances, CDmanager (application used for unbundled product
	installation), starts up a cmdtool without character echoing.  This
	has resulted in users not being able to see the answers to their
	installation questions.  This bug occurs infrequently.
Work Around:
	Quit the cmdtool and try again.
	Restart OW and the CDmanager.
	Use the cdm.

Synopsis:     The 'File Editor' submenu is initialized incorrectly.
Public Summary:
	The 'File Editor' submenu is initialized incorrectly:

	If you pop out the 'File Editor' submenu on an otherwise
	virgin cmdtool, the 'enable' "thin" is pushed in.  Selecting 'Disable'
	brings up a dialog telling you that the 'File Editor' is not enabled
	yet.  Actually, the more it is used, the more confused it seems to
	get...  The 'File Editor' is up, but 'Disable' button is pushed in.

Synopsis:     "META" character is not recognised in shelltool & cmdtool
Public Summary:
	The "META" character shelltool and cmdtool (openwin v2.0), 
	strips the META modifier from input characters.

	It works properly in the sunview shelltool and also when run 
	under openwin/xterm, openwin/psterm, on a serial terminal 
	connected to a tty port, and on the raw console with no
	window system running.

Synopsis:     tilde escapes don't work with tip in a cmdtool under 4.1
Public Summary:
	The tilde escapes in tip don't work in a cmdtool.  They work Ok 
	in a shelltool.
Work Around:
	Use a shelltool with tip or use the "Disable Scrolling" option in 
	the menus to change the cmdtool into a shell tool which doesn't 
	appear to have the problem.

Synopsis:     ttysw (shelltool) params are sometimes incorrect.
Public Summary:
	ttysw (shelltool) params are sometimes incorrect.
Work Around:
	type "stty sane" and then fix up things like
	stty erase, etc...

Synopsis:     ksh in command tool confuses user
Public Summary:
	Running Korn shell in a command tool window might cause confusion 
	for a user after doing command line (vi) editing.

	Scenario:

	1. Start ksh in a command tool window.

	2. Do some command line editing. The window now becomes a ''shell 
	tool window''

	3. Go back to a command tool window by enable scrolling (there were 
	reasons why you were there in the first place)

	4. The user is at this point unable to get any respons (except echo) 
	from the window.

	5. The reason for the problem is that there is at least one 
   	(invisible) character behind the cursor and by moving the cursor 
	behind this character solves the problem.

	6. Unless the user knows what has happened, s/he is stuck with 
	going back to the shell tool again (without the scroll capabilities).

Synopsis:     File completion confuses cmdtool
Public Summary:
	File completion confuses cmdtool.

Synopsis:     can't edit command line if rlogged in to another machine
Public Summary:
	If you attempt to cut, paste and then edit a command after rlogin 
	to another machine, you cannot edit the line.  The text will 
	highlight or whatever but the cursor is not moved and the action 
	(cut, delete, etc.) has no effect. This is a bug in both the 
	cmdtool and shelltool.

Synopsis:     Excessively long command lines are repeated.
Public Summary:
	Entry of excessively long OS command line in cmdtool will not get 
	evaluated.  The line is repeated after carriage return with no 
	action on part of OS.

	Enter many lines of a letter with no spaces or carriage returns.  
	Press return.  Next OS prompt is issued and partial stream of 
	letters just entered are printed.  This is apparently not passed to 
	the OS.  

	Shell tool dos not behave in this manner.  Enabling the scrolling 
	feature does exhibit this behavior.
Work Around:
	Use shelltool or disable scrolling.

Synopsis:     X/NeWS cmdtool - CR to LF mapping. Sunlink PAD bug
Public Summary:
	Bug appears when trying to use the Sunlink 6.0 pad to some remote 
	hosts. If you have "scrolling enabled" option set on your "cmdtool", 
	carriage-return to newline mapping is done automatically by the 
	"cmdtool". When padding to hosts that expect carriage-return as end 
	of line rather than linefeed, end of line will not be seen and the 
	line will not be accepted by the remote host. Additionally as 
	"cmdtool" forwards only a linefeed and pad expects by default 
	carriage-return as the forwarding character, the pad program also 
	will not forward data when return is pressed (this is configurable).
Work Around:
	1) Turn off "scrolling" on the cmdtool. This isn't too nice as when 
	using pad to a "dumb" host its nice to be able to cut, paste, and 
	most of all scroll.

	2) Use xterm. 

	3) Write an envelope around pad that looks something like this:

       	#! /bin/sh

       	# Shadow process will set LF to CR mapping on current tty
       	(sleep 5 ; stty inlcr) &
       	pad $*
       	# Make sure all the children are in (er, that is, dead)
       	wait
       	# Turn it back off
       	stty -inlcr
	
   	This is very ugly but works provided you don't use the "^P<return>"
   	option to change parameters on pad. If you do the modes get reset.

Public Summary:
	The shelltool truncates the y and g characters below the line when 
	underlining the characters.  The lowest two pixels are lost.
Work Around:
	Use cmdtool or xterm.

Synopsis:     continuation from page mode does not work in shelltool
Public Summary:
	The "Continue" item on the "Term Page" menu in sheltool has no 
	effect.  To demonstrate:
	- select the "Enable Page Mode" item on the "Term Page" menu
	- cat a long file
	(one page of the file will be displayed and the cursor will
	become a stop sign)
	- select the "Continue" item from the "Term Page" menu
	(The cursor changes back to an arrow but the text does not advance)

	Typing a <space> when the cursor is a stop sign will cause the text 
	to advance.
Work Around:
	Use scrolling mode.

Synopsis:     cmdtool not vt100-compatible
Public Summary:
	Telnet to a non Sun host in a CMDtool (Specifically, a VMS host 
	running Wollongong TCP/IP, or a McDAtA 6100E connected to an IBM 
	Mainframe) the return key is IGNORED, or is not mapped to an 
	appropriate sequence that their implementation of telnet understands.  
	Telnet to Sun hosts in CMDtool works fine. 
Work Around:
	1) Telnet in shell tool: This works, but doesn't allow scrolling, 
	which is needed because VMS doesn't have pipes and paginators.

	2) Open a Sunview Cmdtool.  This works fine, but sunview windows

Public Summary:
	When starting up "olwm" on a 2-headed system, all shelltools 
	are started with the shell prompt in column 1.  For example:

	SAMPLE BEGIN
	hostname% 
	The cursor would be on the `h' in this case.
	SAMPLE END

	The cursor is in column1 for a multiheaded system.
Work Around:
	Just hit carriage return.

Synopsis:     cmdtool height & width are incorrect when invoking a command
Public Summary:
	Shelltool/cmdtool may have incorrect height and width values
	set when they invoke a command passed to them from the command line.

	For example, the command "shelltool vi" will bring up a shelltool
	which in turns invokes vi.  At the time vi is invoked, the width
	and height *may* be screwed up, depending on timing of requests
	between XView and olwm.
Work Around:
        You can delay the execution of the command by slipping a
	sleep command in.  For example,

		shelltool sh -c "sleep 3; vi foo"

	will probably let the shelltool height and width be set by the
	time vi is invoked.

Synopsis:     shelltool on openwindow has 35 lines instead of 34
Public Summary:
	The terminal types sun and sun-cmd are defined to have 34 lines
	and 80 columns. The sunview shelltool, stand-alone console
	driver, and cmdtool all have 34 lines. The terminfo and termcap
	databases say 34 lines. Yet openwindows 2.0 generates a 35 line window.

	It is true that the window size ioctls override the default on a 
	sun, and therefore vi works correctly on the sun itself. It is 
	also true that 4.3BSD rlogin passes the window size to any 4.3BSD
	machine you connect to. But much of the world isn't running 4.3BSD
	or, does not deal with window sizes. When one rlogins to a typical
	machine (in this case 3B running Sys V, and WIN) it goes by the terminal
	type (sun-cmd) and uses the default size.
Work Around:
	Do not use default sizes on shelltool.

		/usr/lib/.text_extras_menu (Textsw package)

Public Summary:
	It is possible to get into a situation using notify_do_dispatch() where
	the application makes an enourmous amount of PutImage requests causing
	Xlib to block (_XWaitForWritable).   Since Xlib uses select to block
	and the user has enabled background dispatching, XView, instead of
	blocking checks to see if other sources can be dispatched.  In this
	case the same fd that XView is waiting to write to, has events to be
	read.  The notifier detects this and calls Xlib to read the events,
	thus reentering Xlib.
Work Around:
	Avoid the use of notify_do_dispatch().  Turn off background 
	dispatching when you know it is no longer needed: notify_no_dispatch().

Synopsis:     LOC_DRAG event not distributed correctly
Public Summary:
        When the LOC_DRAG event is consumed by a canvas paint window
        that does not consume WIN_ASCII_EVENTS, the window event handler
        is not invoked but the X11/NeWS server holds up distribution
        of events as if the handler were still running, causing a locked
        screen.
Work Around:
        In some cases, consumption of WIN_ASCII_EVENTS is a workaround;
        however, if two subwindows in a frame can consume keyboard events,
        click-to-type input focus is enforced to discriminate between them,
        which is not acceptable.

Synopsis:     window_read_event() while pressing the left mouse button hangs XView
Public Summary:
	When using WIN_X_EVENT_MASK instead of WIN_CONSUME_EVENTS to 
	set the input mask of the window, the event procedure of the 
	window needs to call XAllowEvents when it receives
	a left mouse button down event, SELECT, to release the passive
	grab on the SELECT button.
Work Around:
	1. Encourage the customer not to use window_read_event or 
	   XNextEvent functions in his event/notify procedures.

	2. Grab the pointer back.
	   For example add the following lines to your code :

	#include <X11/Xlib.h>
	Display *display;
	...
	/* canvas_pw is of type Xv_Window */
	canvas_pw = canvas_paint_window(canvas);
	display = (Display *) xv_get(canvas_pw, XV_DISPLAY);
	...
	/* in the event/notify proc */
	while (window_read_event(window,event) ) {
	if (event_action(event) == ACTION_SELECT)
		XAllowEvents(display, AsyncBoth, CurrentTime);

	3. In some cases, you should be able to wait until you get notified
	of the up-event of the select button before explicitely reading 
	events, at which time normal XNextEvents should work.

	4. When a program has declared the event mask with WIN_X_EVENT_MASK
	instead of WIN_CONSUME_EVENTS, you'll see this behavior whether
	you're trying to get input via window_read_event or not.  The 
	workaround is to call XAllowEvents as the program below
	demonstrates . The problem in this case is a bug in XView's 
	private routine  window_release_selectbutton() which does not check an
	X11 style event mask just the old SunView style event mask.  This
	function is called just before the event procedure for the window
	is called.  The reason for the passive grab is for detection of 
	a change in input focus.  If XView does not do a passive grab on
	the SELECT button, events could be lost when users type ahead.  This
	is especially critical in the situation of using click to type. If 
	the library copied the X11 event mask into the old SunView style event
	mask, then that too would stop the bug from occuring.  In the meantime,
	clients that use X11 event masks should use XAllowEvents() to give
	up the passive grab on the SELECT mouse button in their event
	procedures.  This really only applies to the canvas package.

Synopsis:     copy ignores non-xview primary selections
Public Summary:
	Cut and paste does not work correctly between xview 
	applications and the xterm distributed with OpenWindows.
	The xterm distributed with OpenWindows is the same as the
	one currently distributed by MIT, and uses the ICCCM
	selection model.  However, if a selection is made in it,
	then Copy and Paste in an xview application cannot be used
	to transfer it to the xview application.
Work Around:
	Don't mix xview and non-xview apps.

Synopsis:     down-up-down-drag is being treated as double click
Public Summary:
	Down-up-down-drag is interpreted as a pending double 
	click that has not completed. For example, if you select a mail 
	message in the header window, then quickly left down and drag to
	the file manager, the drag and drop cursor doesn't come up.
Work Around:
	Go back to the mailtool and left down again.

Synopsis:     Newline characters dropped during copy and paste.
Public Summary:
	In a cmdtool bring up vi and put the following in it:

		           /* This is a test. */
		           /* This is a test. */
		           /* This is a test. */
		           /* This is a test. */

	Note that each comment is on a new line, and the ``*/'' are on the
	last column in the window.  Select all four lines and hit copy.
	Go to another cmdtool running vi and hit paste.  The four lines
	are inserted, but now they are joined as one line, three newline
	characters have been dropped.

Synopsis:     extending triple click selections is difficult
Public Summary:
	If you triple click in a line to select it, then go to the middle of
	another line and click down on the middle button of the mouse, and
	slide the mouse even one pixel, selection shifts from line mode to
	character mode. This is incorrect; adjustments should remain
	terms of lines.
Work Around:
	You can select a set of lines by multi-clicking SELECT and remembering 
	to hold down the SELECT button as you make the third click, then 
	dragging the mouse to make a wipethrough line-level selection.

Public Summary:

Public Summary:
        When you create a window it sees a WIN_RESIZE before it has finished

        Any client that uses this return value during processing of the

        type of code.
	Work_around for BugsList:
	Set a static variable in main to tell whether or not the app
        has entered vu_main_loop.  If it hasn't and a repaint/resize

        anything.  Just before calling vu_main_loop(), set variable.

Synopsis:     XView textedit not robust when faced with bug in NeWS selection
Public Summary:
	When you make a selection in a textedit window, textedit apparently 
	sends a _SUN_YIELD_SELN request to the old selection.  NeWS clients 
	typically don't support this operation, but that's okay; they just 
	return /UnknownRequest and everything proceeds normally.  However, if 
	there's a bug in a NeWS client that results in a PostScript error, 
	the textedit goes into an infinite loop spewing out selection-related 
	error messages to the console (or wherever its stderr goes, 
	presumably).  This pegs the CPU and in general totally hoses the 
	server.

Synopsis:     menus created for windows w/colormap segs installed do not paint correctly
Public Summary:
	The first time the menu is displayed it appears readible, but in
	2D using the foreground/background colors of the window, but the
	next time it is displayed it appears that XView is trying to
	render it in 3D - but the menu choicestrings do not appear
	until the mouse moves across them and the menu title does not
	appear at all.
Work Around:
	Turns out that colormap handling in V2 XView has changed slightly
	due to the 3D look of 'control' objects: panels, panel_items, menus, 
	etc.  So, in order to preserve the 3D capability for these items, 
	control colormap segments should be used (i.e. On panels, and on 
	canvas's which will have walking menus..).

	(note: this is STILL a bug because XView should be smart enough just
	to render 2D menus when control colormap segments are NOT installed)

	The program below shows how to get around this problem:
	/*
 	* canvas_color.c
 	*    This program demonstrates the use of color in XView. It allows the
 	*    user to choose the foreground and background colors of the canvas.

Synopsis:     page-up/page-down in textsw is wierd in jan_17 build
Public Summary:
	This bug is a two part bug. Both have to do with hitting page up/
	page down in a textsw.

	1. paging does one line scrolls; it should act like clicking on
	the elevator (which repaints the entire screen, which runs much
	faster...)

	2. If you page down when you are already at the bottom of the screen,
	your screen flashes for about 20 seconds (once per line?); this is
	probably intimately tied to #1 in terms of the root problem.

Public Summary:
	If I have a textsw, and select some text in it, the normal behavior is
	pending delete, i.e. the next character typed will replace the selected
	span of text.  If I select a span of text, and then press the "Find"
	key, the pending delete nature is lost, and the next character types is
	simply appended to the selected span.

		/* Get the size of the frame to use for processing resize event */
	
		/* Note: the XV_HEIGHT of the frame will be the height of the interior

	After a few seconds, the application will report the error:

	The selection is not implemented

	Now, the text is still highlighted.  Now hit the Cut key.  Nothing
	will visibly happen to the text, even though it has actually been
	Cut!  To see this, refresh the textsw window, and the text will
	magically disappear.

	There appear to be two problems here.  The first is that textsw
	has some problem with drag & drop.  The second is that the error
	from the drag & drop operation manages to screw up the painting
	routines enough that the screen does not accurately reflect what
	is in the text buffers.

	If a DROP_SITE_ITEM is created on a panel, and a DROP_SITE_REGION

	of about 15 pixels height that runs along the top of the whole
	panel.
	
	This brings up a second problem. The text field normally will
	not accept drops but in this example, it happens to reside within
	that skinny bar, so it can be dropped upon. Doing so generates
	the XView message:

	XView warning: Unable to decode Drag and Drop message (Panel package)

Synopsis:     secondary selection fails to replace primary selection in DeskSet panel items
Public Summary:
	This bug is observed in the control panels of several DeskSet 
	applications, e.g.: mailtool (compose window), snapshot (File load/
	store popup), so I believe it is a general problem in DeskSet apps.

	Note: the following assumes "input focus follows pointer" rather than 
	"click to type" is set in the Workspace properties. 

	Here is how to reproduce the problem:  First, make sure that you have 
	set "Move Pointer" for the "Set Input Area" property in the 
	"Miscellaneous" category of the Workspace Properties window.  Next, 
	bring up a mailtool "Compose" window, and/or a Snapshot "Load..." 
	popup (or just about any control panel of any DeskSet application).  
	In one of the text panel items (for example, the To: field in the 
	Compose window, or the File Name field of the Load dialog), type in 
	a string.  Then select part of this string (primary selection).  If 
	you then type something, it replaces the selected text [this is 
	correct behavior, as expected].  Now again select something in the 
	panel item, but instead of typing, hold down the "Paste" key (L8) 
	and make a secondary selection somewhere else on the desktop.  When 
	you release the Paste key, the secondary selection should *replace* 
	the primary selection.  However, this does not work correctly; 
	instead, the primary selection is deselected, and the secondary 
	selection is *inserted* before it.

	Note that this problem does *not* occur inside of a Text subwindow.
	For example, in the Mail Compose window, you can replace primary
	selections with secondary (as described above) inside of the text 
	window area that contains the message body.  The bug only occurs in 
	the control panel areas, i.e. in the message header fields of the 
	Compose window.
Work Around:
	To work-around this problem: after making the primary selection, 
	press the "Cut" key (L10) to delete the selected text.  Then you 
	can proceed to hold down the "Paste" key and make your secondary 
	selection.  When you release "Paste", the text is inserted in the 
	right place.

Synopsis:     cmdtool can start up with bogus tty settings
Public Summary:
	Cmdtool sets it pty setting based upon information found in an
	environment variable.  In SunView, this variable is initialized 
	by the suntools/sunview program.  In OpenWindows, this variable 
	is initialized by the X11/NeWS server.  Unfortunately, under X11 
	or OpenWindows, cmdtool may not be forked from the server, so 
	this variable will not be present in cmdtool's environment.  If 
	this is the case, cmdtool inspects the tty settings of its control 
	terminal and sets its pty to have those same settings.  
	Unfortunately, the control terminal doesn't always have settings 
	that are reasonable for cmdtool's pty, and so things can get 
	screwed up.
Work Around:
	Type "reset^J" to the cmdtool after it comes up.  You won't be able
	to see what you type, but that command will reset the terminal.
	Alternatively, make sure you start up cmdtool from a control
	terminal that has reasonable modes.

Synopsis:     There is a resize bug/feature of Xview with programs using DGA.
Public Summary:
	There is a resize bug we've been seeing in XView/XGL programs that 
	could be a "feature" of XView.  When the window is resized by the 
	user, the window manager sends ConfigureWindow requests to the server 
	for the outer window (namestripe, decorations, etc.) and the XView 
	FRAME window.  When XView gets the resulting ConfigureNotify event 
	for the FRAME window, it computes new sizes for its child windows, 
	e.g. any CANVAS windows.  It then informs any CANVAS windows via 
	their RESIZE_PROC's of their new sizes and sends appropriate 
	ConfigureWindow requests to the server for these CANVAS windows 
	and their associated CANVAS_PAINT_WINDOWs.  This means that the XView 
	application can be told the new size of a window before the server 
	is told to change the size.
Work Around:
	There is a work around for this feature.  We can explicitly ask for
	ConfigureNotify events on the CANVAS_PAINT_WINDOWs, by setting up an 
	event proc and a mask enabling appropriate X11 events.  There is no 
	way to prevent the first (bogus) resize event from getting to our 
	event proc, but at least we are guaranteed to see a second (valid) 
	resize event as well.

Synopsis:     WIN_COLLAPSE_EXPOSURES doesn't collapse most exposures
Public Summary:
	In response to complicated window operations such as positioning, 
	sizing, drawing, programmatic scrolling, and XClearArea, a very 
	large cascade of WIN_REPAINT events are generated, causing an 
	objectionable number of superfluous screen repaints. Setting 
	WIN_COLLAPSE_EXPOSURES to TRUE does not help.
Work Around:
	The workaround is non-trivial, but it is mostly boilerplate and
	is very effective.  The names of various routines is arbitrary,
	but I am copying the names used in the table package.

	We essentially trap every WIN_REPAINT, and look at the X event 
	queue.  If there are future Expose events for the same window in 
	the queue, we don't repair the current damage.  Instead, we 
	accumulate it on a per-window basis, and repair it later when the 
	last WIN_REPAINT event for that window comes up in the queue.

	After creating the window (canvas, scrollable panel, or panel), an
	event proc is interposed on the paint window using:
	xv_set(paint_window,
		WIN_NOTIFY_SAFE_EVENT_PROC, table_use_event,
		0);
		
	This procedure switches on event_action(event), and catches 
	WIN_REPAINT:

		table_use_event(window, event, arg, type) {
		...
		switch (event_action(event)) {
		...
    		case WIN_REPAINT:
			if (!table_postpone_repaint(window, event))
				(void) notify_next_event_func(window,
		       		(Notify_event) event, arg, type);
			return NOTIFY_DONE;
		...
		}

	I expect that most clients that need this workaround already have
	some client routine interposed on the paint window already, so
	they'd just need to modify the WIN_REPAINT case.

	edge of the same text window.  Release the button.  The window beeps 
	and the text does not move.  I tried the same thing in V2 and it 
	works fine; V3 seems to be too sensitive to being near the edge of 
	the window.  Note that this is important functionality since, even 
	if you've triple-clicked to select the line, if you drag it to a 
	point that's NOT at the left edge of the window, it'll move the line 
	into the MIDDLE of the destination line.
Work Around:
	Use cut'n'paste instead of drag'n'drop.

Synopsis:     xvps: images are flipped on repaint event
Public Summary:
	An implicit flip is done by xvps when a repaint event occurs.
	Because most, if not all, applications already use pscanvas_
	flip or flip the image by other means (i.e. translate then
	do a 1 -1 scale), this causes the image to repaint in the
	wrong direction.  
Work Around:
	Call pscanvas_flip() in the repaint proc for the PSCANVAS again.

Synopsis:     WIN_BORDER,TRUE causes window_fit(panel) to size the frame too large.
Public Summary:
	Setting WIN_BORDER to TRUE in xv_create(frame, PANEL, ...) causes the
	window_fit(panel) to be size the frame larger than the panel.  Resizing
	the frame than causes the created panel's size to remain fixed instead 
	of extending to edge.

	Shrinking the window to a size LESS THAN the created panel, followed 
	by making the window larger than its original size works properly.
Work Around:
	Do not set WIN_BORDER, TRUE.  However this changes the appearance of 
	the client and may be unacceptable.

Synopsis:     Frame pkg does not handle ConfigureNotify's correctly.
Public Summary:
	Before xv_main_loop() is called, a typical frame may be resized
	several times as new windows are added to it, or window_fit is
	called.  Each time the frame's size changes a ConfigureNotify
	event is sent to it.  Since xv_main_loop() has not been called
	yet, these ConfigureNotify events are queued up.  They are read
	only after xv_main_loop() is called.  As these events are
	read and passed to the frame pkg, the frame pkg thinks these
	events were generated by some user action with the window manager.
	It then re-lays out the subwindows, which is very expensive.
	The frame pkg does not take into account the fact that these events
	were generated by earlier ConfigureRequests made by the frame pkg.
