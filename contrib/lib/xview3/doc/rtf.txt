XView 3 Product Notes



o	Cut-and-paste between PANEL_TEXT items and TEXTSW is not supported.


o	To ensure XView application binary compatibility between releases, all 
libraries should be dynamically linked.  If libraries are dependent on other 
libraries that are statically linked, binary compatibility may not be 
maintained between releases.  For example, if libxview is dynamically 
linked, then all other libraries on which it depends (libolgx, libX11, 
libc) must also be dynamically linked.


o	If selection transactions do not complete successfully (e.g. mailtool 
attachments do not display data or drag and drop fails), it may be because 
you are using an eight megabyte system or a system that is too heavily 
loaded. This is caused by selection time outs. The selection time out value 
for XView-based applications is the time a requesting application will wait 
for a response from the selection holder. In general, the default three second 
time out is sufficient for a selection transaction to complete. If your selection 
transactions are failing, increase the default selection time out to 10 seconds 
by putting the following in the .Xdefaults file in your home directory 
and then restarting the OpenWindows session:

	selection.timeout: 10


o	The complete OPEN LOOK Mouseless Model is only enabled when 
OpenWindows.Keyboard.Commands is set to FULL.  Refer to the XView 
Programming Manual for information.


o	If you compile an XView application statically and do not specify -lc as a 
library to link against a compiler warning is issued:

	ld: /lib/libc.a(flsbuf.o): _fflush: multiply defined

The workaround is to specify -lc as a library to link against.
