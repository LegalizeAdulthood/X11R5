What Is OLWM:
------------
Olwm (OpenLook window manager) is an ICCCM compliant window manager
supplied for use with the XView toolkit.  It requires the graphics
library, olgx, in the contrib/lib/olgx section to build.  Olwm is also
dependent upon the OpenLook fonts found in the contrib/toolkits/XView/fonts
directory.  By default, these fonts are already included in the FCS
X Version 11 Release 4 and Release 5 distribution.  You will only need
these fonts if you are using an older version of the server.

A man page for olwm, olwm.man, can be found in this directory.
