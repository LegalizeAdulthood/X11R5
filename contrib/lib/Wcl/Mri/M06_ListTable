  Scrolled Lists in Tables
  ------------------------

  This resource file presents the way one must deal with scrolled lists
  which are managed by Table widgets.  In the layout resource for the
  Table widget, we must name the scrolled window, NOT the list:

        *table.layout:          quit    0 0 1 1 hH ;\
                                slistSW 0 1 1 1

  If we simply said "slist" instead of "slistSW" then nothing
  appears, because slist is not one of the children of table.
  Rather, slistSW is the child of table, and slist is the
  child of slistSW.

  As an aside, the layout options hH on the quit button allow
  resizing to work nicely.  Compare the behavior of the Table
  with the resize behavior of XmRowColumn.  I think you will
  prefer Table over XmRowColumn.
