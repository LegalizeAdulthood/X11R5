Widget Creation Library is a simple package allowing to define the
X toolkit widget hierarchies and their binding to the application
using X resource files. Several convenience callbacks and action
procedures are provided to support the basic widget tree dynamics.

Widget Creation Library (Wcl) 1.06 is a re-packaged version of David
Smyth's Wcl 1.05. The major functionality change is the addition of
template instancing and support for OLIT and Cornell University
widget sets. Minor changes are due to several bug fixes.
For details, please refer to RELEASE.NOTES in the Doc/ subdirectory.

The distribution contains files which make up the Widget Creation
Library, Ari, Mri, Ori and Cri Resource Interpreters (for Athena,
Motif, OLIT and Cornell widget sets), several versions of Table
widget, test programs for each widget set and several demos.
The distribution can be built on X11R5, X11R4 and OSF/Motif 1.0 
systems. Wcl and Motif support can be built on VMS, but no scripts
are provided with this distribution.


README Files and Documentation
------------------------------
The Doc directory provides Postscript and pure text documentation. 
I hope you will find the comments in the source files useful. 
Also, several example resource files are provided with extensive 
comments. Man pages for the installed programs (Ari and Mri) are 
provided.


Building The Distribution using Imake
-------------------------------------
You will probably need to edit the Wc.tmpl file in this directory.
Comments in the file tell you what to do.  After editing the Wc.tmpl,
you can build the distribution very simply.

    % cd Wcl_top_level_directory
    % xmkmf 
    % make World  >& make.World

Note: `make depend' may not work, and is completely unecessary for
this release.

Building The Distribution using previous X11 releases
-----------------------------------------------------
The distribution is set up for the MIT X11 release 5. However, the Wcl
code is designed and has been tested to build using X11 R4 as well as 
X11 R3 flavor of Xt Intrinsic provided by OSF with Motif 1.0.x. The
distribution includes additional files for pre-R5 and pre-R4 environment.
If you plan to use instancing with the pre-R5 X release, please pay 
attention to RELEASE.NOTES


Building The Distribution without Imake
---------------------------------------
If you do not have the MIT X11 distribution, you should be able to build
Wcl simply following your vendor's recomendations for building X/Xt
applications. 
Wc (Wcl core) only requires X (Xlib) and Xt (X toolkit Intrinsics).
Xp,  Ari and DemosAthena require Wc, Xp  and Athena (Xaw) widget set.
Xmp, Mri and DemosMotif  require Wc, Xmp and Motif  (Xm) widget set.
Xop, Ori and DemosOlit   require Open Windows 3.0 (OLIT 2.5).


Testing The Distribution
------------------------
I have included a simple test csh script which executes all of the
example programs.  After you build, the test program will execute
all of the executable targets it finds.  Just do the following:

    % test


Installing the Distribution
---------------------------
The Imakefiles generate an install target which causes the libraries to
be installed, and the applications re-linked on machines which support
dynamic linking.  Dynamically linked applications must be re-linked
during installation so the applications reference the installed
libraries, rather than the ones in the build tree. 
Note: The DemoAthena and DemoMotif programs are not installed.

    % make install
    % make install.man

To test the installation, you must direct the test script to look for
files in your app-defaults location, for example:

    % test /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/

Note that trailing "/" is NOT, repeat NOT optional.


Acknowledgements
----------------
David Smythe, formely of JPL, is now working in Germany. Due to problems
with his network connection, his contributions are not included in this
release; however, the next releae (Wcl 2.0 ?) will be a merge of both
efforts.

Kim Gillies (gilliges@noa.edu) provided the OLIT and Cornell University
widget set support.

Ron Newman (rnewman@bbn.com) provided several bug fixes and suggestions
for further improvements.

Several other contributed by observations and bug-reports.
