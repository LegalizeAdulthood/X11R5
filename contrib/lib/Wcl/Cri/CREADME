This directory holds the beginnings of support for Gene Dyke's Cornell widgets.
It assumes you have obtained version 1.6 that is compatible with X11R5.

This directory has test programs for most of the Cornell widgets including
versions of the demos that are in the Xcu examples/xlayout directory.  

The directory Xcp has the source for CriRegisterAll.  I added callback
functions for the public Xcu functions.  One callback, XcuBmgrManageCB is
needed to make bmgr widgets work in Wcl.

I have not added the Wlm widget at this time.

I would be interested in hearing of problems, suggestions, or improvements
you have.

The Xcu widgets are available via FTP from 128.84.247.85.
