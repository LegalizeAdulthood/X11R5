This directory contains the documentation for the Widget Creation
Library.

The files with .doc suffixes are pure text files, and contain
updated Wcl and table widget documentation.

The subdirectory Doc.105 contains compressed postscript files which
contain viewgraphs for a Wcl tutorial and a paper which is close to
being a reference or programmers manual, as shipped with Wcl 1.05
by David Smyth. Note David does not work for JPL anymore.
