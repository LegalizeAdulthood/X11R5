Ok, don't think of it as part of XLFD.  It's not part of the font name
under any circumstances; it will never be returned by ListFonts, it
never shows up in a font name property.  It's a directive to OpenFonts,
useful in conjunction with XLFD.

This whole issue sort of sputtered out.  I'd like to get some more
discussion going on it before the meeting at the conference.

Actually, I think this is a real problem.
As I understand it, we are responsible for controlling access to the
Motif source.  This means we can't have it sitting around publicly 
readable on all our machines.    I fully expect anything unprotected
will be copied to non-BU machines, even though this violates our
"ethics policy" on BU machines.  Yet, people read the documentation
and justifiably come asking about source to the demo programs.
I can't make everyone who is interested in learning Motif sign a
license agreement.   I don't want to have a special Motif machine
that only a privileged few can sign onto and I'd rather not maintain
a list of authorized people.   It would be nice to have some public domain
example source that I can put on each system when I install the 
Motif libraries and header files.   We do this for other packages,
people can just look in /usr/local/examples for programming examples.

I'm posting this note to announce that there will be an informal "birds of
a feather" session on the WINTERP OSF/Motif Widget INTERPreter at the
upcoming 5th Annual Tech. Conf. on the X Window System.  The conference is
happening at the Boston Marriott Copley Place in Boston, Massachusetts,
14-16 January 1991. I figured that since I'm attending this conference, I
might as well get together with any current or prospective WINTERP users.

The BOF will be held on Tuesday, January 15 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM. For
details, see the schedules posted at the conference.

I'd like to use this session as an informal information exchange:
	* For interested folks to find out more about WINTERP.
	* To get input on desired features and improvements.
	* Discuss upcoming plans for WINTERP (e.g. the real soon now
	  WINTERP 1.1 // Motif 1.1 release)
	* Exchange ideas on how people are using WINTERP for application 
	  prototyping.
	* Find out how people are using WINTERP as a platform for building
	  customizable/extensible applications.
	* Discuss issues: WINTERP vs. UIL, WCL, Tcl, Builders, UIMSs, etc.
	* etc.

If you are planning on attending, please reply by e-mail to
mayer@hplabs.hp.com (or {decwrl,sun,etc}hplabs!mayer). If you want, you may
also suggest further topics for discussion.

PS: for further info on WINTERP, see the proceedings of Xhibition '90 (pls
ignore formatting and spelling errors introduced by ICS), or see the
proceedings of the EXUG First European X Conference (Sept 1990). 

PPS: The following is a blurb introducing WINTERP and telling you how to
get this software:
			--------------------
WINTERP: An object-oriented rapid prototyping, development and delivery
environment for building user-customizable applications with the OSF/Motif
UI Toolkit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINTERP is a Widget INTERPreter, an application development environment
enabling rapid prototyping of graphical user-interfaces (GUI) through the
interactive programmatic manipulation of user interface objects and their
attached actions. The interpreter, based on David Betz's XLISP, provides an
interface to the X11 toolkit Intrinsics (Xtk), the OSF/Motif widget set,
primitives for collecting data from UN*X processes, and facilities for
interacting with other UN*X processes. WINTERP thus supports rapid
prototyping of GUI-based applications by allowing the user to interactively
change both the UI appearance and application functionality. These features
make WINTERP a good tool for learning and experimenting with the
capabilities of the OSF/Motif UI toolkit, allowing UI designers to more
easily play "what if" games with different interface styles.

WINTERP is also an excellent platform for delivering extensible or
customizable applications. By embedding a small, efficient language
interpreter with UI primitives within the delivered application, users and
system integrators can tailor the static and dynamic layout of the UI,
UI-to-application dialogue, and application functionality. WINTERP's use of
a real programming language for customization allows WINTERP-based
applications to be much more flexible than applications using customization
schemes provided by the X resource database or OSF/Motif's UIL (user
interface language).

An environment similar to WINTERP's already exists in the Gnu-Emacs text
editor -- WINTERP was strongly influenced by Gnu-Emacs' successful design.
In Gnu-Emacs, a mini-Lisp interpreter is used to extend the editor to
provide text-browser style interfaces to a number of UN*X applications
(e.g. e-mail user agents, directory browsers, debuggers, etc). Whereas
Emacs-Lisp enables the creation of new applications by tying together
C-implemented primitives operating on text-buffer UI objects, WINTERP-Lisp
ties together operations on graphical UI objects implemented by the Motif
widgets. Both achieve a high degree of customizability that is common for
systems implemented in Lisp, while still attaining the speed of execution
and (relatively) small size associated with C-implemented applications.

Other features:
	* WINTERP is free software -- available via anonymous ftp from
	  expo.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/winterp/winterp-1.01.tar.Z
	* Portable -- runs without porting on many Unix systems.	
	* Interface to gnuemacs' lisp-mode allows code to be developed
	  and tested without leaving the editor;
	* Built-in RPC mechanism for inter-application communications;
	* XLISP provides a simple Smalltalk-like object system.
	* OSF/Motif widgets are real XLISP objects -- widgets can be
	  specialized via subclassing, methods added or altered, etc.
	* Automatic storage management of Motif/Xt/X data.
	* Contains facilities for "direct manipulation" of UI components;

You may obtain the current source, documentation, and examples via
anonymous ftp from host expo.lcs.mit.edu: in directory contrib/winterp you
will find the compress(1)'d tar(1) file winterp-1.01.tar.Z. Slides, papers
and further documentation can be found in directory contrib/winterp/papers.

There is also a mailing list for WINTERP-related announcements and
discussions. To get added to the list, send mail to
winterp-request%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com or hplabs!hplnpm!winterp-request.

The  XtDisplay ..etc function causing core dumps is a  behaviour ;-) 
that was introduced with the advent of X11R4/Motif 1.1.  There are 
some talks about incompatible specs between R3 and R4.
  
I noticed this  too when moving some applications from Motif 1.0.x to 1.1.

Use  XtDisplayOfObject()  to get around this problem.

 XtDisplayOfObject(object)  

Widget object ;   /*  object whose display is to be returned */

Ok I won't, but many resources are passed by reference, strings, structures
etc. It is a weakness of Xt, but there you go.

This won't help you with the (many) other ways resources get values.
You might as well dispense with the pretence and write a function, say
SetAxis(widget,axis,value) .

    Ok, don't think of it as part of XLFD.  It's not part of the font name
    under any circumstances; it will never be returned by ListFonts, it
    never shows up in a font name property.  It's a directive to OpenFonts,
    useful in conjunction with XLFD.

Hmm, OK, I understand better now what the intention is.  But I think I like
it even less.  Essentially you are introducing a loophole mechanism for making
arbitrary semantic changes to OpenFont without going through any kind of
real change to the X protocol.  (Of course, introducing scalable font matching
does this too, although [I think] in a less severe way.)  It seems to me that
if there is both an outline and a bitmap, and you really want to distinguish
them, then they *should* have distinct names.  E.g., you really do want both
of them to show up in a ListFonts, right?  Otherwise how do you know that
the server supports this magic?

    This whole issue sort of sputtered out.  I'd like to get some more
    discussion going on it before the meeting at the conference.

Agreed.  Jim Fulton, are you putting together an agenda for the meeting?

	We want to build a menu application in X11R4/Motif 1.0.3 (soon
to be Motif 1.1) that has the 'grey out' functionality in the menus.
I.E. We want to build a menu, and depending upon the state of the application,
prevent the user from selecting some of the menu items.
	Some of this could feasibly be done through mwm, but generally
we  can't use the f.nop of Mwm because these temporary windows aren't 
controlled by Mwm.
	I know how to do this through creating the menus using pushbuttons 
when selectable and labels (in a different font) when not.  However, I don't
want to create a new menu with different widgets each time the selectivity of
a command changes. Could I use the same menu widget switching sub-widgets
between displays?  How?
	Could I work within the pushbuttons, ie change the font of the label 
and change the callback function, then re-realize the menu on demand? This 
seems the best solution to me at present.
	Is there some easy way to do this I don't know about?
