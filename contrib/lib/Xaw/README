                                 of
                          Athena Widget Set


The i18n of Xaw(Xaw-i18n) is based on the original Xaw library, core
distribution of X11R5 from MIT.  The Xaw-i18n consists all new widgets
which should be added into the Athena Widget set.  A whole i18n'ed
Athena Widget set is made of the original widgets and this Xaw-i18n parts.
So the new extended widget set is compatible with X Consortium's core
Athena Widget set.

Actually the Xaw-i18n is twin of the original Athena widgets, i.e., each
widget involving with Latin-1 string is modified to produce a new one
being capable for multibyte(multilingual) string.  For example, the Label
widget is modified to a new one LabelLocal widget which handles the
multibyte string encoded in the locale of fontSet.

The name for these new widgets is cohered a word "Locale" with the
name of the original widget.  You can imagen very easily there are
such new widgets: CommandLocale widget from Command widget, SmeBSBLocale
object from SmeBSB object, and so on.  The exception is in Text widget,
the name of the twin of Ascii text widget is Multi, such MultiText from
AsciiText.

Using MultiText widget you can easily to make a multilingual editor like
xedit.  The file codeset of the MultiText is decided with the locale of
fontSet, the inter-client communication codeset for such cut/paste operation
is Compound Text Encoding.  The internal buffer of MultiText widget is
encoded for multilingual, i.e., locale-independent.
For example you can paste a Chinese string, encoded in the locale zh_CN.ugb,
into the MultiText buffer, and you can also insert a Japanese string, encoded
in the locale ja_JP.ujis, into the buffer.  The MultiText widget can be
connected with the Input Method to input multibyte characters. One of such
Input Method is xwnmo.

All new widgets is listed as follows:

	CommandLocale Widget
        DialogLocale Widget
	LabelLocale Widget
	ListLocale Widget
	MenuButtonLocale Widget
	SmeBSBLocale Object
        ToggleLocale Widget
	MultiText Widget
	MultiSource Object
	MultiSink Object

You can see easily where they are produced from. The following widgets
are modified to match the new widget set:
 
	AsciiSource Object
	AsciiSink Object
	Text Widget
	TextSource Object
	TextSink Object

So you should define the compile directive to be -DXI18N to distinguash
from the original Athena Widget set.

All other widgets, not mensioned here, are still same as the original
Athena Widget set.

To build i18n-Xaw you should use the following commands:

	% cd Xaw
	% xmkmf <Topdir> <Curdir> (you may set Topdir and Curdir)
	% make includes
	% make depend
	% make all

After building, It can be installed in your local bin using:

	% make install


--It is very simple work,
  however needs man's hands to do it at all.
