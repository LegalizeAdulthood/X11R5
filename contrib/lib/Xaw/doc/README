The Xaw-i18n part is modified from the original Xaw, so the document
is modified from them also, some are just copied and changed keywords.

If the sontent of section is not contained here, it means to read
it in the X Consortium's standard document "Athen Widget Set -- C
Language Interface".

If you want to know the diffiation, please use the command diff which
is almost the enemy of copying command. :-)
