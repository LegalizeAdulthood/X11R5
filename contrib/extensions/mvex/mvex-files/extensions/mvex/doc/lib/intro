Section 1: Introduction

.LP
This document describes
.PN MVEXlib ,
the client library for the Video Extension to X.
It assumes the reader is familiar with Xlib and with the MVEX Protocol.
This initial draft does not attempt to duplicate much of the MVEX Protocol
document and the reader must rely on that document to understand the
semantics of many MVEXlib routines and data structures.
.LP
.PN MVEXlib 
does not have an explicit initialization routine.  Each routine will attempt
to initialize the library if it is not already initialized.  A client
can determine whether or not the MVEX extension is available in a server
by using the core routine,
.PN XQueryExtension.
This routine must also be used to obtain the MVEX event and error base numbers.
The name of the extension is "MVEX".
.LP
Library initialization does an implicit call to
.PN MVEXQueryVideo .
Client access to information sent in the server reply is through these
routines:
.PN MVEXOverlapsOfScreen ,
.PN MVEXTimestamps ,
.PN MVEXGetVisualInfo ,
.PN MVEXGetVins
and
.PN MVEXGetVouts .
All information returned by these routines remains valid for the life of
the connection.
