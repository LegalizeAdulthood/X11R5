Enclosed in this directory find the specification for an X synchronization
extension, and a rational for its design and use.

We had hoped to have a sample implementation finished in time for the
R5 contrib tape, but we did not succeed at completing the implementation, 
(we felt that FRAMEEND counters support is important to its demonstration,
along with updating demo programs to the revised design).  When complete,
(expected by the end of November, 1991) an announcement will be made and the
source will be made available for an implementation of this specification.

Public discussion of this extension should be directed to the
appropriate newsgroups/mailing lists.
