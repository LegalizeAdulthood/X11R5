README -- xpipeman
 
Xpipeman is a game of skill requiring the user to connect together
pieces of a pipe to allow a liquid to flow through without
leaking out. The aim of the game is to connect as many pieces of pipe 
to the start block as possible before the liquid flows out of the
end on the pipe (see manual page for further details).

X11R5

This program has been tested under X11R5. The only changes required
were in score.c because Xos.h apparently did not bring in sys/file.h.

--------------
Compiling Details:

xpipeman can be compiled by either using the Imakefile or by using the 
hand generated Makefile.tra.

Compile time parameters:  

 	  MAXSCORES -- the number of high scores that you want to keep.
 	The default is 20.

 	  The default directory for the binary and score file is the current 
	directory.  You'll have to modify the makefile or copy the binary
	if you want it to install elsewhere.  xpipeman will attempt to
	create the scorefile (SCOREFILE) at runtime.  

  There is a little bsd-ish stuff in score.c.  flock is used to stop a race 
condition.  If you don't have a bsd-like flock, you could probably 
comment it out.  The race condition (multiple users writing to the 
score file) is probably rare.  If SYSV is defined, this will be ifndef'd
out.

  If your compiling this under X11R3, define the term R3 in the makefile or
imakefile.  This will make the include references look like those expected
by X11R3 instead of X11R4.
