1¡¥Configuration

  In the file "config.sh", set the following variables for where Canna
  is be installed in, 

    irohaBinDir     the path name where commands would be installed in.
    irohaLibDir     the path name where libraries would be installed in.
    DicDir          the path name where dictionaries would be installed in.
    ErrDir          the path name where the log file would be installed in.
    LockDir         the path name where the lock file would be installed in.
    LockFile        the name of the lock file.

  example(also default):

		irohaBinDir = /usr/local/bin
		irohaLibDir = /usr/local/lib/iroha
		DicDir = $(irohaLibDir)/dic
		ErrDir = /tmp
		LockDir = /tmp
		LockFile = .IROHALOCK


2.Compilation

  The following command will make Canna using "imake".

		# make iroha

  If there is no "imake " environment, see mit/config/README.

3.Installation

  3.1 port number

    To set a port number for communication between server and its clients, 
    append the following line in "/etc/services".

		iroha        5680/tcp

    (If your system uses "NIS", do above modification on the
    master server machine of NIS.)

  3.2. To install

    To install Canna, type the following commands.

      1) make install
          To install all of Canna.

      2) make instserver
          To install the environment of kana-to-kanji conversion
	  server.

      3) make instclient
          To install the environment of Canna clients.

      4) make instsgs
          To install the sgs environment of Canna.

    The directories where Canna would be installed in are defined in

     |

  3.4 logfile and lockfile

    1) logfile
      When kana-to-kanji conversion server starts, it creates a
      logfile to print out its messages. 
      The Directory where the logfile should be created in is defined
      by "$ErrDir", and its name is "IROHA0msgs".
      The following is the default.

			/tmp/IROHA0msgs

    2) lockfile
      In Canna, one dictionary cannot be handled by plural
      kana-to-kanji conversion servers. A lockfile created by the
      server at its start up time, in order to prevent this. The path
      of the lockfile is defined by "$LockDir/$LockFile", the default
      is the following.

	     		/tmp/.IROHALOCK      


4. running Canna

  4.1 To start kana-to-kanji conversion server

    The following command starts the server.

		# irohaserver

    The irohaserver forks itself and runs background, so you don't
    have to type '&' explicitly.
    To start it when your unix system come up, append the following
    lines in the "/etc/rc"(BSD) or some other rc file.

                rm -f /tmp/.IROHALOCK*
                /usr/local/bin/irohaserver
                echo 'irohaserver started.'


  4.2 To terminate kana-to-kanji conversion server

    The following command terminate the conversion server.

		# irohakill

    The conversion server contains some dictionary data, and
    these data must be reflected to corresponding dictionary files.
    Killing irohaserver loses the data. Using "irohakill" command to
    terminate the conversion server prevents the the loss of data, as
    they will be written back to disk when the conversion server dies.


  4.3 Dictionaries

    (1) kana-to-kanji conversion dictionaries

      Canna's dictionaries are stored at a "dictionary home
      directory". The directory is defined by a variable "$DicDir".
      You can also change the directory when you start up the
      conversion server.
      For example, you can change the directory to
      "/usr/local/lib/iroha/dic" by typing:

		# irohaserver /usr/local/lib/iroha/dic

      The "dictionary home directory" contains the following.


              -+-- *.rdic
               |           romaji-to-kana conversion table
               +-- iroha
               |           dictionary directory for system
               +-- user
               |           dictionary directory for user
               |
               + user1
               + user2
               + user3
                  :
                  :

      The "dictionary home directory " must be readable/writable by
      the server.

    (2) romaji-to-kana conversion table

      Canna uses a romaji-to-kana conversion table in the "dictionary
      home directory" by the default.

      A user can use his own romaji-to-kana conversion table in place
      of it.

  4.4 Customization

    Canna provides a customization file by which a user can customize
    the input method system, which is $irohaLibDir/default.iroha, or
    $HOME/.iroha, or the file defined by the environment variable
    $IROHAFILE. In this file, the user can set environment for the input
    method, key bindings, the romaji-to-kana conversion table,
    kana-to-kanji conversion dictionaries, etc.

    See doc/man/input/3.custom.
