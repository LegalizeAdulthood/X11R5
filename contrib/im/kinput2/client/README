This directory contains a simple client-side library for the kinput2
protocol, and a patch for kterm that makes kterm use kinput2 protocol
and over-the-spot conversion.

* Files
	convlib.c	-- a simple client-side library

	kconvert.c
	kterm.patch	-- patch for kterm.


* How to make kterm with over-the-spot conversion capability?

1. Since this release doesn't contain kterm source, you have to obtain
   one from somewhere. This patch is for kterm version 4.1.0, but
   can be used for 4.1.2 as well.


2. Replace convlib.c and kconvert.c in the kterm source directory
   with those in this directory, copy ../include/ConvProto.h,
   then apply kterm.patch.

	% cp convlib.c kconvert.c kterm.patch <kterm source directory>
	% cp ../include/ConvProto.h <kterm source directory>
	% cd <kterm source directory>
	% patch < kterm.patch

4. Now you can build kterm with xmkmf and make.

	% xmkmf
	% make
