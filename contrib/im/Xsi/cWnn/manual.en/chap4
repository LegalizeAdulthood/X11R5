   4.2 cserver - THE STARTUP OF THE SERVER    
   =======================================

 * Description 
	cserver  -  The multi-user Chinese server.

 * Standard path 
	/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/cserver

 * Command format 
	cserver [-f file] [-s file]

 * Function 
	cserver  provides  the  services and  resources required  by the users (clients) 
	during the conversion.
	The  input  environment  is  provided  by the  front-end processor (uum), which 
	sends  the  conversion request  to the cserver,  which subsequently performs the 
	service.

	Normally, once  the system is up, fork() will be executed and the server runs as 
	background process. 
	The startup  of cserver can be set in "/etc/rc"  to be executed automatically in 
	the Unix system.

	When the cserver command is executed, all the files defined in
	"/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/cserverrc" will be read and the appropriate operations will 
	be performed.
	Besides,  all  dictionaries  and  usage  frequency  files of the clients will be 
	maintained by the cserver. Please refer to section 5.2 for more details. 

 * Function options 
	-f file  --  "file"  will  be set as the initialization file, which replaces the 
		     default cserverrc.

	-s file  --  "file" will be set as the logfile of cserver.
		     When  "file"  is  defined  as "-",  the logfile will be sent to the 
		     standard error output.

   4.3  uum - THE STARTUP OF THE CLIENT    
   =====================================

 * Description  
	uum, -  The execution of the Chinese input front-end processor.

 * Standard path 
	/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/uum

 * Command format 
	uum[-h/H] [-x/X]
		[-k uumkey_file] [-c convert_key_file]
		[-r auto_file] 	  [-D server_hostname]
		[-n username]     [-l number of lines for conversion input]
		[-L lang]

 * Function description 
	The default input automaton definition directory is 
	"/usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk_p/".

	Once uum is executed, the initialization file is searched in the following 
	order : 
  	    (1) The file specified by the WNNRC C-Shell environment variable.
  	    (2) @HOME/.uumrc
  	    (3) /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/uumrc  (standard path)

	The communication  between  uum  and  cserver is  via the socket where uum 
	sends a conversion request to the cserver, which will perform the conversion
	request and pass the result back to uum.



















					- 4-3 -
 * Function options 
   	-H  	The input mode will be set to ON after the startup of uum.

 	-h   	The input mode will be set to OFF after the startup of uum(default).

   	-X 	During uum startup, the flow control of tty is ON (default).

   	-x	During uum startup, the flow control of tty is OFF.

	-k  uumkey_file 
		Set  the key code definition file.  By default, it is searched in the
		following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setuumkey in the uumrc initialization
	   	    file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/uumkey
	
	-c  convert_key_file 
		Set  the key code conversion file.  By default, it is searched in the
		following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setconvkey in the uumrc initialization
		    file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/cvt_key_tbl

	-r  auto_file 
		Set the input mode definition file of the input automaton.
		By default, it is searched in the following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setautofile in the uumrc 
		    initialization file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk/mode

	-l  lines
		Indicates the number of lines for the Chinese input operation.  
		(0 < lines < window line-1).  The default value is 1.

	-D  server_hostname
		The user can select the server from another host by using this 
		option.  If no hostname is specified, the one specified by the
		environment variable CSERVER will be used.
		Each  environment of  the client can be set by defining in the 
		"setconvenv" initialization file.

	-n  username
		Indicates the username for the client. The value in environment
		variable CWNNUSER will be taken as the default value.  If CWNNUSER 
		is not defined, the username of the current client will be taken.

	-L lang
		Indecates the language.
		For chinese zh_CN, for japanese ja_JP.

 * Note
	During  the startup  of uum, a "pty" is required from the operating system. 
	If "pty" is unable to be obtained, uum startup will fail.
	Similarly, if the initialization file, input automaton definition files and 
	key code definition file are not read in, uum startup will also fail.

   4.4 wnnstat - REPORT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE SERVER   
   ======================================================

 * Description 
	wnnstat  -  To show the current status of cserver.

 * Standard path 
	/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/wnnstat

 * Command format 
	wnnstat [-w] [-e] [-E] [-f] [-F] [-d] [-D] [-L lang] [hostname]

 * Function 
	To request  for the current execution status of the server for the current host 
	or another machine given the hostname.
	With the function options as shown below, different information can be obtained.

 * Function options 
  	-w   	List username, hostname, socket number and the environment number.

 	-e   	List environment number, environment name and reference count.

  	-E   	List environment number, environment name, reference count, grammatical 
		file number, dictionary file number and the filenames.

  	-f   	List file id of each cWnn file in the server, the file type, location of 
		file, reference count and filename.

	-F      Same as -f

  	-d   	List dictionary number, type, file number, filename and usage frequency 
		filename of the dictionaries.

	-D   	List dictionary number, type, conversion method, number of entries, 
		static/dynamic, current usage status, priority, alias, file name, 
		[(alias:usage frequency filename)], [password (frequency password)]
		of the dictionaries.

	-L lang
		Indecates the language.
		For chinese zh_CN, for japanese ja_JP.
 * Note
	Dictionary number is different from file number. 
	File number refers to the standardized number among cWnn files.
	Dictionary number refers to the logical dictionary number in the server.
	One dictionary may consist of different usage frequency files.
	Different conversion methods make use of different dictionaries.
