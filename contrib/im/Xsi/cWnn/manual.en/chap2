   2.1 CWNN STARTUP AND TERMINATION   
   ================================

	After the  installation of cWnn (refer to appendix 1), the system is ready to be 
used.  First of  all, the user needs to startup the server before he can use cWnn, which 
is  the client.  Only one server is needed.  Once  the server is up, it can be shared by 
several uum's.
 

1. Startup of Cserver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start the server, type the following command at the C-Shell prompt :
	+------------------------------------------------------------+
        | %  cserver  <CR>                                           |
        +------------------------------------------------------------+

The  standard path of cserver is  "/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/ ".  If the user has not set this 
path, he  can  either  set the path or type the full pathname of cserver while executing 
this command.

Once the cserver is up, all the clients are able to use it.  The server will read in all 
the  necessary  dictionaries  and  grammar files, after which the C-Shell prompt will be 
ready to receive commands again.


2. Startup of cWnn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start cWnn, type the following command at the C-Shell prompt of a Chinese window 
( eg. X-window and Gmw ). 
	+------------------------------------------------------------+
        | %  uum  <CR>                                              |
        +------------------------------------------------------------+

The  standard path for cWnn is similar to  that  of the  server, "/usr/local/bin/cWnn4/". 
Many clients  can  be  started  at the same time on different windows, but served by the 
same server.

	During the execution of the uum command, the folloing status will apper.

        +---------------------------------------------------------------+
	|                                                               |
	| %                                                             |
	| [---]                                                         |
        +---------------------------------------------------------------+


	cWnn is now ready to be used.  To enter the input mode, press <CTRL-SP>.  
To leave the input mode, press <CTRL-SP> again.


3. Termination of cWnn 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to terminate a cWnn process, type the following :
	 +------------------------------------------------------------+
         |                                                            | 
         | %  exit <CR>          (or)  %  Ctrl + d                    | 
         | [---]                                                      | 
         +------------------------------------------------------------+

The server will save all the usage frequency files and dictionaries of the particular
client and terminate the connection between itself and that client.

 
4. Termination of cserver 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To terminate the server, type the following command :
	 +------------------------------------------------------------+
         | % wnnkill <CR>                                             | 
         | Cserver Terminated                                         | 
         | %                                                          | 
         +------------------------------------------------------------+ 














					- 2-2 -
If some other clients still exist, the following message will be displayed.
	 +------------------------------------------------------------+
         | % wnnkill <CR>                                             | 
         | Cserver Not Killed                                         | 
         | %                                                          | 
         | [---]                                                      | 
         +------------------------------------------------------------+ 

For more details, please refer to Chapter 4.


Note :  The <CR> at the end of the command line represents a carriage return.

   2.2 STANDARD INPUT ENVIRONMENT   
   ==============================

	The standard input environment of cWnn is supported by the automaton.

Standard path : /usr/local/lib/wnn/zh_CN/rk/  (default) 

The following shows the input methods that are available in this environment :

	Pinyin input, Zhuyin input			(PF1)
	Wubi input, Cangjie input			(PF2)
	Quanjiao input, Banjiao input			(PF3)
	Quwei input, Neima input			(PF4)

   2.3 PHONETIC INPUT METHOD    
   =========================

	This input  method  makes use of the Chinese pronunciation to perform the Pinyin 
to Chinese  character  conversion.  We will now show how the Pinyin input method is used. 
For details on the Pinyin-Hanzi conversion, refer to Chapter 3.

	After the startup  of uum, press <Ctrl-SP> to enter into the input  environment.
The user  will be  able  to see the  prompt  as shown below, after which Pinyin input is 
possible.

4. The Input Process 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    (a) Pinyin input method 
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	First, the user needs to enter into the required input mode.  For example, enter 
	Pinyin mode through PF1.  
	The  Chinese  pronunciation can  be entered with or without the four tones.  Any 
	arbitrary length of pronunciations  is allowed and user can correct his mistakes 
	by  just  moving  the cursor  to the  particular position and do the correction, 
	without having to re-type the entire Pinyin string again.

	The system  will  perform  an  auto-checking for the Pinyin entered, to ensure a 
	legal Pinyin input.  


	The following keys can be used to manupulate the input :

	Function keys  		Functions  
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	 ^F (or ->|)	To move the cursor one position to the right.  
 
	 ^B (or |<-)   	To move the cursor one position to the left.  
 
	 ^D 	 	To delete the character on the cursor.  
 
	 ^E 	 	To move the cursor to the end of the input string.  
 
	 ^A	 	To move the cursor to the front of the input string.  
 
	 ^K      	To delete all the input characters from the cursor 
			position till the end of the input string.

   2.4 OTHER INPUT METHODS 
   =======================

	Besides Pinyin input method, cWnn provides other methods to input Chinese.

1. Encoded Input Method (Bianma Input Method) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To input a Chinese character, the user needs to input according to the components 
of the character.  Currently,  a few  hundred  types  of Bianma  input methods have been
developed.   cWnn  provides the commonly  used methods such as Wubi and Qianma.  However, 
being system  independent, any  input method can be installed easily into cWnn. To input 
via  Wubi or Qianma method, just enter into the respective input mode using the function 
keys. 

(a) Wubi input method 	This method uses up to four keys to represent one Chinese 
			character,  and  each key represents one component of the 
			character.  Once  the  four  components  are entered, the 
			system  automatically  performs  the conversion to Hanzi.
			If  components  do not correspond to a Chinese character, 
			the input will be cancelled automatically.

			If the  Chinese character  requires  less than four keys, 
			the input can be completed by pressing the space bar.

			When the  user  is  uncertain  of  the  components of the 
			Chinese character, he can enter "?" or "z" as a  wildcard 
			to select all the  possible characters. The way to select 
			the correct  candidate is similar to Pinyin input  method.

(b) Qianma input method This  method  uses  three  keys to represent one  Chinese 
			character, and  each key represents one component  of the 
			character.  Once  the three  components are  entered, the 
			system  automatically perform the conversion to Hanzi. If 
			the components do not  correspond to a Chinese character,
			the input will be cancelled automatically.

			If the  Chinese character  requires less than three keys, 
			the input can be completed by pressing the space bar.

			When the  user  is  uncertain  of  the components  of the 
			Chinese character, he can enter "?" or "z" as a  wildcard 
			to select all the possible characters. 
			The way  to  select  the correct  candidate is similar to 
			Pinyin input method.
