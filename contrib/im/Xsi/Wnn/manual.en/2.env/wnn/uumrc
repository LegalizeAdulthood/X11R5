NAME
    uumrc  -  Kana to Kanji conversion front-end processer(uum(1))
	      initialization file.

SYNOPSIS
    /usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/uumrc (default)

DESCRIPTION
    uumrc file sets up the environment for the uum. Individual settings
    can be specified for each user.  Duplicate entries will be overwritten.
    Lines that start with a semicolon (;) are comments.

    The following settings are specified in this file.

	include  <path> 
	     Read in all the initialization files defined in <path>. 
	     Used when user needs to add his own definitions. 

	setconvenv <wnnenvrc_path>
	setconvenv <wnnenvrc_path> sticky
	setconvenv  <host> <wnnenvrc_path>
	setconvenv  <host> <wnnenvrc_path> sticky
	    Specifies the path of Kana-To-Kanji conversion environment
	    setting file.
	    The default path is "/usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/wnnenvrc".
	    If <host> is given, the environment will be created on the
	    If sticky, the environment will be left in server after
	    uum exited. That environment will be used at next connection.
	    It is for performance.

	setkankanaenv <wnnenvrc_path>

	setkankanaenv  <host> <wnnenvrc_path> sticky
	    Specifies the path of Kanji-To-Kana conversion environment
	    setting file.
	    The default is "/usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/wnnenvrc_R".
	    If <host> is given, the environment will be created on the
	    If sticky, the environment will be left in server after
	    uum exited. That environment will be used at next connection.
	    It is for performance.

	    The default is "/usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/cvt_key_tbl".
	    The terminal name must correspond to that defined in the
	    environment variable TERM, or else the definitions will
	    be invalid. "*" can be used for the terminal name.

	not_send_ascii_char
	    When the input line is empty, ASCII characters will be sent to the 
	    conversion buffer (default).

	send_ascii_char

	    the conversion buffer.

	waking_up_in_henkan_mode

	    This will depend on the width of the screen.  Default number is 36.

	setmaxhistory  <number> 
	    Specifies the maximum number of entries for the conversion history.
	    Default value is 11.

	excellent_delete

	    keys are still valid.

	remove_cs

    In top of include, setuumkey, setrkfile, setconvkey, setconvenv,
    setjishopath, sethindopath, setfuzokugopath, setkankanaenv,
    the following abbreviations can be used : ~, ~username, @HOME
    @LIBDIR, @LANG
	~ 		The value of environment variable HOME .
	usrname 	The home directory for the user in "/etc/passwd".
	@HOME 		The value of environment variable HOME .
	@LIBDIR 	The path "/usr/local/lib/cwnn".
	@LANG 		The first 5 character of environment variable LANG.

    In setjishopath and sethindopath, first @USR is the user name
    of uum (refer to uum(1)).

CAUSION
    The file name of Dictionaries or frequency files are in the machine of
    jserver to which uum will connect. If the specified user dictionaries or
    frequency files are not exist, these will be created in the machine of
    jserver
