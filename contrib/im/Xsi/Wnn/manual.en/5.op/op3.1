< Figure 2.3.1 >








(2) Input of "readings"

The state where readings are being input is called "reading input mode". 
Text which is converted to kanji is, in principle, always in hiragana.Input 
is always in insert mode. When inputting in the middle of a line, the character 
string to the right of the cursor (including the character under the cursor) 
is pushed sequentially to the right. Readings are displayed underlined.  When a 
"$" is displayed at the head or tail of the conversion line, a portion of the 
line has been scrolled off screen at the head or tail of the line.

(3) Conversion

When the convert key is pressed, continuous phrase kana-kanji conversion takes
place, and the "reading" display is replaced with "kana-kanji mixed text", and
edit mode is entered. It is possible to edit in this mode. This is covered in
part (4) following.
If the desired kanji are displayed, then no edit is necessary and you can
proceed directly to the confirmation phase covered in part (5) following.


(4) Editing

When the desired kanji were not displayed by the conversion operation, the text
can be edited by the operations described in the following table. This state is
called "edit mode".
