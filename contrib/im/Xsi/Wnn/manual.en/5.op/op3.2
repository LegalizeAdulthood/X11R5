(5) Confirmation

When the Execute key is pressed, the mixed kana-kanji text from the conversion
line is transferred to the cursor's original position on the screen, and the
display of the conversion line at the bottom of the screen is cleared.
Also, the same effect as pressing the Execute key and the Return key in sequence
sequence is achieved by pressing the Return key only.
Pressing the Execute key after entering a reading results in the same effect
as entering the reading directly without using the conversion process.
