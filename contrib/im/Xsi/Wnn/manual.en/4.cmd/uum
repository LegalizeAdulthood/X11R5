UUM(1)

NAME
    uum - Kana-To-Kanji conversion front-end processor

SYNOPSIS
    /usr/local/bin/Wnn4/uum [-J|U|S] [-j|u|s] [-h|H] [-x|X]
		[-k uumkey_file] [-c convert_key_file] [-r romkan_mode_file]
		[-D host_name] [-n user_name]
		[-l conversion_line_number]

DESCRIPTION
    Uum is a command which provides japanese input/output environment.
    Once uum is executed, the initialization file is searched in the following 
    order : 
  	    (1) The file specified by the UUMRC C-Shell environment variable.
  	    (2) $HOME/.uumrc
  	    (3) /usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/uumrc (default)

    Uum is able to connect with jserver of other machine via the inter-net.
    Then a charge of each machine becomes low.
    If the connection with jserver failes, uum can be executed. Then uum
    provides operations which need not connection with jserver. And When
    the conversion key is pressed, uum attempts to connect with jserver if
    it doesn't connect with jserver.

    Uum accepts the following options:

	-H  The input mode will be set to ON after the startup of uum.
		(default).

	-h  The input mode will be set to OFF after the startup of uum

	-U  The code of pty side will be set UJIS. (default)

	-J  The code of pty side will be set JIS. (default)

	-S  The code of pty side will be set Shift-JIS. (default)

	-u  The code of tty side will be set UJIS. (default)

	-j  The code of tty side will be set JIS. (default)

	-s  The code of tty side will be set Shift-JIS. (default)

	-X  During uum startup, the flow control of tty is ON (default).

	-x  During uum startup, the flow control of tty is OFF.

	-k  uumkey_file 
	    Specifies the key code definition file. By default, it is searched
	    in the following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setuumkey in the uumrc
		    initialization file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/uumkey
	
	-c  convert_key_file 
	    Specifies the key code conversion file. By default, it is
	    searched in the following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setconvkey in the uumrc
		    initialization file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/cvt_key_tbl

	-r  romkan_mode_file 
	    Specifies the input mode definition file of the input automaton.
	    If this is a directory name, "mode" file in it is refers.
	    By default, it is searched in the following order :
  		(1) The filename indicated by setrkfile in the uumrc 
		    initialization file.
  		(2) /usr/local/lib/wnn/ja_JP/rk/mode

	-l  conversion_line_number
	    Specifies the number of lines for the Kana-To-Kanji conversion. 
	    (0 < conversion_line_number < window line-1).
	    The default value is 1.

	-D  host_name
	    The user can select the jserver of another host by using this 
	    option.  If no hostname is specified, the one specified by the
	    environment variable JSERVER will be used. if it is not
	    specifies, the alias "jserver" in /etc/hosts is searched.
	    And if it is not specifies too, UNIX_domain will be used.

	-n  user_name
	    Specifies the user name for the client. The value in environment
	    variable WNNUSER will be taken as the default value.  If WNNUSER 
	    is not defined, the username of the current client will be taken.

NOTE
    During the startup of uum, one "pty" is required from the operating
    system. If the "pty" is unable to be obtained, uum startup will fail.
    Similarly, if the initialization file, input automaton definition files
    and key code definition file are not read in, uum startup will also fail.
