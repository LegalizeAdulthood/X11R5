1. Environment for the test

  0S : UniOS-B, UniOS-U, UniOS-Mach
  Machine :
     Can use X-Window (X11R4 or higher version).
     Can use XWNMO.
     Can use color bitmap display (for the color indication).

 The test tool files should be put at proper place.

2. The way of the test

  Each function is tested by using XIM test tool. You should investigate 
 the results of the test and check whether XIM acts rightly.

  The testing procedure for each library function is shown as bellow.
 [CR] means to hit return key.

  2.1 Setting of the environment

    2.1.1 Create or append to the file ".Xdefaults" as follows in the home
          directory.

          *xim.foreground:               yellow
          *Xim.Background:               black
          *xima.foreground:              white
          *Xima.Background:              forestgreen
          *ximb.foreground:              blue
          *Ximb.Background:              red

    2.1.2 Append the following to your file `.cshrc'.

	(1) setenv LANG ja_JP.ujis
        (2) setenv XMODIFIERS @im=_XWNMO
        (3) setenv XIMLOGDIR (the DIRECTORY for locating your log file later)

    2.1.3 Log file

      The result of the testing is arranged into log files.
     Some of the log files show like these:    

          "tim.log?", "ticon.log?", "ticover.log?", "ticoff.log?",
          "ticroot.log?"

      (note) "?" means consecutive numbers.

      Actual file arrangement shows as follows(In the case of the directory
     of the log files is "$HOME/xim/test/log").

        $HOME/xim/test/log ибибииибиб /logfile001/  ибибииибиб tim.log
                               ив                       изибиб ticon.log1
                               ив                       изибиб ticon.log2
                               ив                       изибиб ticover.log1
                               ив                       изибиб ticover.log2
                               ив                       изибиб ticoff.log1
                               ив                       изибиб ticoff.log2
                               ив                       изибиб ticroot.log1
                               ив                       ижибиб ticroot.log2
                               изибиб /logfile002/  ибибииибиб tim.log
                               ив                       изибиб ticon.log1
                               ив                       изибиб ticover.log1
                               ив                       изибиб ticover.log2
                               ив                       изибиб ticover.log3
                               ив                       изибиб ticoff.log1
                                                        ижибиб ticroot.log1

	(The "logfile001" is the name of sub-directory typed for putting
	the log files in the first testing and the "logfile002" is for the
	second testing. It is better to specify a meaningful sub-directory
	name for the management of the results of testing.) 

  2.2 The way of the compilation

    Input commands as below.

        (1) $ cd ./ [CR]
        (2) $ make -k [CR]

  2.3 The way to execute XIM test tool

  (1) Execute xwnmo.

  (2) Open window(kterm) to indicate the contents of this test.
       (note) This window size has to be 80x24.

  (3) Input commands as follows on the window just opened from step (2).

	 $ cd ./ [CR]
         $ ximtest logfile001 [CR]
         (assume the sub-directory's name to locate log files is "logfile001".)

  (4) The way of the test has two parts, auto test and manual test.
     Auto test means the test program checks functions automaticly. Manual 
     test means the user chooses command from  menu window and checks the
     results.

      In the case of the manual test, the input window (X11R5 XIM Test) and
     the menu window (X11R5 XIM Menu) are used.
