	SEP - SpotLocation Extended Protocol

SEP is a protocol realizes quickly movement of spot location.

Normaly, operation of cursor movement in appications follows:
	nested_list = XVaCreateNestedList(dummy, XNSpotLocation, spot NULL);
	XSetICValues(ic, XNPreeditAttributes, nested_list, NULL);
	XFree(dpy, nested_list);
Applications like terminal emulators must move cursor frequently, thence 
this operation causes applications a great deal of performance down.
SEP solves this problem. Applications use SEP or call only the following
function:
	_XipChangeSpot(ic, spot_x, spot_y);

For feather infomation about _XipChangeSpot(), please see SEP part of
man of xwnmo.
