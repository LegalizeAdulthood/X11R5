Htt is Sun's multilingual Input Server for the X Window System V11R5.

Htt is using the XIMP version 3.5 protocol as a method for the communication
between the Input Method library.
This protocol is clean enough in terms of X Window because
it only uses the client message and the property defined by
the X Window system, it will not require any other communication
primitive such as own socket connection.

　　Htt's forte:
     o having good interoperability with other IM server.
       which is compliment with the XIMP protocol.
     o Supports multiple language engine.
     o Supports multiple style
	As a input style:
		Preedit Nothing (root window by Htt)
		Preedit Position(over the spot by Htt)
		Preedit Callback(rendering by client)
	As a status style:
		Status Nothing  (drawn in the Htt's status window by Htt)
		Status Area     (drawn in the client's area by Htt )
		Status Callback (rendering by client)
	As a lookup choices style:
		Display in the Htt's status window
		Display in the Htt's popup window
		Lookup Choice Callback (rendering by client)

Since this release has concentrated on supporting i18nXView as a client
and the i18nXView carries SunOS4.x/JLE1.x dependencies, this Htt had tested
with
	Callbacks through i18nXView
	SunOS/JLE's language engine through libmle.so.1.4

Since libmle.so.1.3 has crucial bug (It causes immediate core dump)
you have to use libmle.so.1.4 or later for SunOS/JLE engine.
Therefore this directory contains libmle.so.1.4 for SPARC.

To build and install the Htt, type 
	make Makefiles
	make depend
	make
	make install
in contrib/im/Ximp/sun/Htt directory.

To run the Htt, type
