*Installation

  You can make it by Makefile. At compiling, you have to define one of the
 following definitions.
 
   - DFUJITSU_OAK    : To use OAK dictionary made by FUJITSU
   - DSJ3_DICTIONARY : To use SJ3 conversion engin (libsj3.a)

  If the above difinitions are ommited, the frontend which supports only
  HIRAGANA/KATAKANA conversion is made. If both difinitions are defined,
  the frontend can switch multi-dictionary at run time.
