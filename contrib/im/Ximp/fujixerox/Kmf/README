  This program is a sample implementation of XIM Server using XIMP protocol.
This XIM Server suports
	PreeditCallback,
	PreeditPosition,
	PreeditNothing,
	StatusCallback,
	StatusArea,
	StatusNothing
XIM input styles.

  When XIM input style is (PreeditNothing | StatusNothing), root-window style,
User Interface of this XIM Server is different from typical XIM Server.
By typical XIM Server, context is shared by all IC (Input Context)
that use root-window style.  But by this server, each IC has independent
context, and single root preedit/status display area displays the context
that is belong to an active IC.  And this display area displays the context
that is belong to IC that has an other XIM input style.

  This XIM Server has two sample implementation of input method.

  One is sample of US compose sequence, refer more details to Template.c.
This implementation don't use any OS / machine dependent interfase,
able to compile and run on several machines.

  The other is SUN's JLE (Japanese Language Environment) CM interface.
This implementation use libmle.a, JLE speciffic interface to input method,
able to compile and run on SUN's JLE ONLY!!

  If you wish to implement the other input method, rewrite Template.c.
Refer to Template.c for more details for rewriting.


NB:	Original C locale data file for Ximp is not handle iso8859-1 GR
	if you use iso8859-1 within C locale, you should install
	Codeset database in this directory.



  Have fun !!!
