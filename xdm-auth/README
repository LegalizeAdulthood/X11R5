If you are looking for the file mit/lib/Xdmcp/Wraphelp.c, be advised that
export of this software from the United States of America is assumed to
require a specific license from the United States Government.  It is the
responsibility of any person or organization contemplating export to obtain
such a license before exporting.  You will find what you are looking for,
in compressed form, as the file /etc/help on this machine.

Although it sounds stupid, and it is, we would appreciate if you would
only tell other people how to find this README file, and not point them
directly to the actual source code, so that they will read this warning.

For persons outside the US, a compatible version of this file, implemented
outside the US, can be obtained by anonymous ftp to ftp.psy.uq.oz.au
(130.102.32.1) in the directory /pub/X11R5/.
